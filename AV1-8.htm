<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Just
in time! The Screen hums and the rock bounces off. Immediately I sense another movement
from the other direction, and I instinctively put up another Screen to shield
myself, this time without reaching my hand out, not having the time to do so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy was right. It is better not to make flowery movements. Fighting is not
dancing. She is holding back lesser now that I am warmed up, and the rocks are
coming faster and getting bigger. The exercise is getting serious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
block another one, back at the previous direction. They are heavier too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Get
creative, Aesena Varinas! Try out your series of combos, different spells and
maneuvers. <b><i>Iacal</i></b>! <b><i>Iacal</i></b>!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
has laid out dozens of rocks in a wide circle with me at the centre, launching
them inwards in turn. Now two more are being shot like bullets, but my eyes can
catch their movement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Just
barely! “<b><i>Arpica</i></b>!” I extend my palms out to either side, and both
rocks freeze in mid-air. Well, not literally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“<b><i>Shoosh</i></b>!”
I exclaim, the ice-encased rock coming in just inches from my face before it
drops to the ground, this one properly frozen. Had I not-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
am still holding my hands out like a scarecrow, but the next rock is not
waiting for me as it aims for my back. The Screen shines a bright blue as it
materialises, cutting off the rock’s trajectory, then it blurs and fades out. I
pant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Close
one there, youngling. Do be alert. I really do not wish to be ridden with guilt.
If you get hurt, we might not do this again anytime soon.” Miss Breezy warns.
“This activity is because I trust your skills. Please prove me right.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
was an absolute surprise that Miss Breezy agreed to this at all. The
inspiration was from the training session that involved 'Yippa'-ing rocks at
myself to practice my Screen Abilities, which by itself took me a week to get adequately
good at. I just thought that it would be better exercise for my reflexes and
sense of coordination if I am not the one directly ‘calling the shots’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
the main reason is that this is fun! I also want to see if my Quick Mind potion
is working properly too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
reflect on my counters: I should not have held my hands out like that. It used
too much time and it opened myself up to blind-spots. Four rocks launched in
such quick succession is a new high score, however, so I am still proud. Even
more so when I recovered so well from my carelessness, though I must still refrain
from repeating my mistake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Holding
up a hand when casting spells seems so natural to me though. It feels so
strange otherwise!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
breathe in. “<b><i>Resmedella</i></b>,” I whisper, newfound energy coursing
through my veins. “Next wave!” I announce. It will be the tenth one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Three
stones within my vision leap at me from their static idleness. I quickly note
their position before turning around, registering another two coming my way
from the other direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There
are too many rocks to focus on to cast a spell directly on each of them. My
eyes and my concentration are not that refined yet. Miss Breezy must want me to
fully encase myself in Screening to block them all at once, something that I
took to call ‘Force-field Hemisphere’. But this session is not for testing the
endurance of my Screens, it is to assess my speed and quick-thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If
I decide to handle them individually: I can do two rocks at most, maybe three;
then the others I can use a Screen, maybe on both sides. Can I afford to try?
Failing would only lead to a little head wound, or a broken arm, but it would
be nothing that the Healing Spell can’t heal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>An
impulsive idea arrives, and like a falling blanket it covers all other thoughts.
A gut feeling comes but once, and I need to utilise it to its utmost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
turn back to the three rocks, looking firstly at the leftmost one then the
middle, calling out “<b><i>Arpica</i></b>!” to both of them in turn, and they
stop in their tracks like flies crashing onto a spiderweb. The remaining one
might come faster than the other two behind me. I have enough time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
hope. It would definitely be a headwound if I fail – this one is about the
level of my eye – but I would be granted a new skill by luck if I get it right. If I would get a headwound, then I <b><i>would</i></b> get a headwound; my future is set. 
If I would learn it, then I <b><i>would</i></b> learn it; my future is set!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
put up a Screen, but this time I push it forward, pushing even harder in its centre
where I concentrate most of my energy onto, trying to form a tip. Like forming
a pointed dent on a shield, as if an arrow just barely failed to puncture it. I
realise that my arm is up again, but I do not have the attention capacity to
bother for now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
rock reaches me, and I punch it straight through with the Screen on my fist.
Willed by my imagination, the Screen folds inward to wrap itself around my arm
like armour, and the Sharpened tip I made shatters the rock with a loud
shocking burst of sound, though I am too excited to be shocked right now. By
instinct, I whip around and give the last two rocks one clean horizontal slice,
and they too split into a million pieces of dust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
stand there like that for a long breathless moment, trying to fathom all the
little movements that culminated in what I just did, how it worked. The
translucent blueness is still enveloping my hand, as if I just transformed my
arm into a glowing blade. Sharp Abilities! It really looks like a force-field gauntlet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
only come back to my senses after all the rocks that were so circularly aligned
around me lower themselves onto the grass. I let the Sharp blink out and brace
myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
know, I really should be upset with you for so dangerously risking yourself
like that, but I must admit…I’m very impressed,” Miss Breezy says with a hint
of awe in her voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
feel myself beaming with relief and a sense of achievement, like some kind of
heavenly warmth actually filling me up from toe to head. “Thank you, Miss
Breezy,” then I look down, pressing my thumbs together, “Sorry, Miss Breezy.”
Is she not going to continue this session?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It’s
alright. I just need to get used to the many more short bursts of panic attacks
that I will have throughout the next few years,” she huffs, “It’s no small
achievement though, child, that you could innovate on your Screen to develop
your Sharp Abilities.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“The
idea came over me, so I thought to try it out. Like…just a feeling,” I tell
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It
means that your mental and physical coordination of all that you’ve learnt is
flexible, and so you can adapt however you want.” Her praises make me want
more. “Making an offence weapon from a defence gear has historical background
too,” she adds, “The peoples of ancient times found that iron and steel make
better shields, and therefore they can be made into better swords and spears.
Something like that. Screen and Sharp.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It
feels a little scary, to be honest. My first proper weapon.” I flex my fingers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Then
let it make you more cautious throughout your missions, that even though you
can wield it, you should avoid resorting to it. After all, you’re just a child,
and applying Sharp Abilities in combat can lead to deadly consequences. Yes?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod solemnly. Of course I know what she is alluding to. My time-travelling
duties may be dangerous and all, but there is still a strong accompaniment of
adventure and wonder and bubbling joy, all which would disappear if I am faced
with a trauma unfit for my age. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
to hope to never shed blood might be too wishful, and even I could not be naïve
enough to believe that all my missions would be peacefully accomplished. There
is a reason that there are so many books about combat and battle strategy in
the library.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Well
then, shall we get back to it?” Miss Breezy asks, prompting a grin from me as I
leave my thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
rocks lift up from the ground. I remanifest my Sharps, but this time on both my
arms, feeling like a Wonderknight. The Sharps feel a little different from
Screens in how they cling to me instead of being repelled, enveloping inwards
instead of always being in a push. I think noting that difference makes it
easier for me to command my Abilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
don’t need to stay in one spot,” she advises, “I’m speeding up, so don’t block
every rock head-on. Free up your focus. I know that you want to challenge
yourself by seeing how fast you can react, but you can do so next time. Just
switch to-and-fro between your Abilities and your spells for today. Test them
out for fun.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then,
just as I am getting into position, I feel it, like the entire world is being
dropped onto me. But the feeling fades as quick as it surfaced. Still, I know that
my energy has blinked out, and the Healing Spell can no longer do much as a
remedy. The Sharps have disappeared, the fatigue too heavy to maintain them;
the fatigue most probably caused by my discovering them, actually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“<b><i>Yippa</i></b>.”
A tiny whisper, and a small bottle flies into my hand. I drink up half of the
concoction in the span of five seconds, the coolness of it slightly reinvigorating
me, though not entirely nullifying the daze which is still gripping me tightly
in its hold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy’s presence closes in immediately. “Oh, of course. I should have seen
this happening. Sharp Abilities is a harder tool compared to its defensive
counterpart, and you didn’t get access to it the traditional way either.” Her
tone harbours increasing worry. “Let’s adjourn. Come, child, back to the
study.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
at least have the energy for that. The green of the field turns to polished wooden
flooring at the bidding of my mind, and I stumble to the big red chair at the
desk, plopping myself down onto it. I squint and rub my eyes, trying to regain
my bearings, then I bring the bottle back up to my mouth to continue drinking,
throwing my head back to get that last drop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Second
Wind?” She deduces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
breathe out. “Yup. I actually made this a sweeter version of it.” It was very
bitter before. The honeyhangs that I added to the recipe did not hinder the
potion’s effect, I decide. After all, I am feeling less exhausted now, so that
means it is working properly. <b><i>Less</i></b>, but I still am, though at
least my head is not spinning as much as it was ten seconds ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Second
Wind’. Such a cool name. Fitting too. Not exactly a huge ‘gust’ of energy, but
a mere light ‘breeze’ is enough to get the gears in the human body up and
running again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
really do like making adjustments to stuff, don’t you?” An accurate remark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod with a giggle. This is actually the first time I realise that trait about
myself, though maybe it is just because of recent events. “How much energy do
Sharp Abilities use?” Maybe Miss Breezy put off teaching them to me because of
my unreadiness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It
depends,” she answers, “In your case, it’s because this is your first time, and
you did it unconventionally. Do consult me next time, but…,” she sighs, “You’d
need to practise the way you did with your Screen Abilities.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
decide not to accept that delicious offer. “But that’s not really necessary,
right? For now?” There is a reluctance in my voice that even I can hear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“There’s
only a little more than a week left before the jump, so yes, we should focus on
your Screens and your other skills.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Right,
exactly, I must relieve myself of the curiosity to understand how Sharp
Abilities work until everything is prepared. Though actually, my lessons have
been completed far ahead of time, and we are just doing revisions. That is
important too, I guess. Just in case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
week left…My heart aches and empties, then it somehow feels as if it is
shrinking into itself over and over again. I clear my head, not wanting to
trouble myself with those thoughts for now. They can wait for sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
stand up and swipe a hand dramatically to the left, calling the alchemy wing
up. Shelves and racks lean out here and there like a folded paper unfolding,
sometimes half-spitting drawers and cupboard doors before swallowing them back
playfully. Liquids of as many colours as they are shades in one beautifully
arrange themselves, casting an aesthetic professionalism to my desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I’m
in an adventurous mood for potions.” A little mind exercise will be fun, I need
to wait for my energy to replenish so I can get back out on the field later
anyway. “Second Wind can honestly use a buff.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Now,
youngling, what’s exactly on your mind?” Miss Breezy inquires warily. “To
concentrate the concoction? The amount and ratio of the ingredients is
specifically meant to suit your age. To meddle with them could be disastrous.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
try to structure an explanation. “In Senses Surge, the recipe has sallingsand,”
I point to the grey-green powder on a rack, “which, as the main ingredient,
enhances the senses. Another potion, the Higher Drive, has strength-amplification
properties because of frostrings that inhibit the nerve system’s influence on
the muscle-overuse and The Blood Of Vijules which temporary increases energy
output,” I point to the tiny vials of golden liquid as I recall what I have
read word for word. The frostrings are in one of the drawers, I think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy listens intently, or as intently as I assume she is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Second
Wind uses celanrels which readjust the soreness around the body and orange
dartwings which numb that redistributed soreness. Frostrings kind of have
numbing properties too, so can’t it replace the dartwings?” That is quite the
structure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
hums. “Alright. First list out the recipe for Second Wind. I’ll explain from
there.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Um,
orange dartwings, celanrels, nightglass, six-of-wendies, and quite recently,
honeyhangs,” I add that last one cheekily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“So,”
she begins, “celanrels and six-of-wendies are flowers that grow in the rare
wild, but usually in the same region and would not be too far from one another.
Their properties complement each other in that the six-of-wendies speeds up the
blood-recirculation process of the celanrels. That much you’ve read before,
yes? And nightglass is the moderator.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy continues: “Orange dartwings are the natural pollinator for both celanrels
and six-of-wendies. The properties of these insects hide in their thoraxes, and
when crushed they mix with the flowers, with the mixing becoming much easier if
there is nightglass, and altogether they make a well-rounded refreshment
potion. It’s very abiding to The Law Of Nature that they work well together,
and that fact also makes the creation of the recipe possible in the first
place.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
did not actually know that they are all ‘neighbour ingredients’. But it still
is not an explanation for fr-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Frostrings
will inhibit the complementing process of those ingredients,” she is not finished,
“I know that you wish to modify the potion such that not only would Second Wind
be energizing, but it would also give your strength a boost. No can do, it will
spoil the mixture instead. And even if otherwise, you cannot simply replace the
dartwings with frostrings weight for weight. It will take tons of experiments.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
I lack too much experience. But she did not say that, of course. It is a
realisation I can make on my own, yet to be curious sometimes means to be
overconfident, and failing to meet the expectations of curiosity can be quite the
downer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Ah,”
I try to absorb as much as I can from the explanation “I see.” I think my
disappointment might be too conspicuous. Miss Breezy can catch every expression
I make.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Well…alright,
let us try something,” she says “It’s called ‘Blending’, but not like squishing
fruits together or mixing eyeshaders. Actually, they are a bit alike…Maybe not.”
Her indecision prompts laughter from the both of us. “Anyway, you can use Magic
to add the properties of one ingredient to another.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Like
in Featheriser? And the Invisibility Potion?” One of the ingredients in
Featheriser needs a spell in order to dissolve into the solution, like an
oil-and-water scenario. The Invisibility Potion has a specific spell as an
ingredient itself, which is quite extraordinary, and is one of the concoctions
I have not brewed yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Very
different. I’m talking about Rune Magic. Oh,” Miss Breezy notes my widened
eyes, “Oh, yes. We totally forgot. Three days ago, wasn’t it?” She laughs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
recall that we were discussing about the workings of Conjuration Magic, how
certain aspects could affect the duration that a conjuration can last and how
conjurations casted by the most skilful hands could still be unstable. And yes,
I remember now: it all started because I was curious as to how long the
illusion of the forest could maintain itself, with its sheer size and
complexity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then
through that discussion, the term ‘Rune Magic’ popped up along with ‘Hymn
Magic’, but we kept jumping from sub-topic to sub-topic and many such
elaborations were put aside for a more interesting subject to be breached. My
overexcitement at the things Miss Breezy were teaching me must have probably
served as a contributing factor too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Engravings
and Scripted Circles, that’s the two branches of Rune Magic. Which one does
Blending need?” I think of the two as ‘symbol-drawing’ and ‘symbol-drawing in a
circle’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“The
former. Now Rune Magic is different from Incantations; you can’t make your
own.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
cannot help but smile at that. “Something about the language of mags, right?
The hidden language of Magic.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Yes,
a whole other subject on its own. That lesson must wait. It’ll be a <b><i>very</i></b>
long lesson indeed. <b><i>Very</i></b> complicated, though nothing you can’t
understand, but…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“We’ll
focus on Blending for the moment,” I finish for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
sense approval from Miss Breezy. “The scroll on the second level of the first
rack from the left, the green-lidded one; it has the list of potion-related
runes,” she informs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
it unfolds until its length reaches the floor. “<b><i>Uppipity</i></b>,” I
call, letting the spell float it up into the air for me. So begins my
endeavour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Thoroughly
mystified but transfixed by the intricate foreign letters, I cross from the
afternoon into the evening. It is as if each of them is speaking to my eyes in
magical hums and rings, the sound of it echoing in my mind, and I wonder if I
am truly hearing all this, or maybe my first exposure to this ancient art might
be overwhelming me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Each
curve its own meaning, each line as well, each dot and flick.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
though we are not directly diving into the depths of Rune Language, the
heaviness of the superficial details is already baffling me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
sit at my desk, the scroll now not the only document floating as books like ‘Adden
Relimitation’ and ‘On Runes in Potions’ join it in the air. It is the way I
have studied in the library for the past few days. The big red chair can have
wheels whenever I want it to have wheels, so I can conveniently roll myself back-and-forth
from the alchemy wing on the left to the Magic wing on the right. Study table
goals, to be honest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>On
the table are dilution-flasks and beakers that are spitting vapour from their
mouths and in front of them are half a dozen bottles of unusable Second Winds,
failed products of my experiments with Blending. It was difficult to make the
frostrings’ properties budge, and when they do at all, my attempts instead
resulted in the dartwings becoming less compatible with the other ingredients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
cannot seem to grasp the amount of energy I need to put into the Rune, and I
struggled with the timing as well. Miss Breezy’s knowledge is also limited on
such an experimental project, so she let me do most of the thinking, which she
probably knew was what I preferred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
still gave it your all, child, and that should be enough for you to feel
satisfied.” Miss Breezy consoles. “This is a very advanced workout.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
huff, a little exasperated at myself. “There’s still so much to learn. I don’t
mean for the jumps but…just learning in general.” I put my chin on my palms as
I stare at the one rune I have been focusing all my mind on for the hours that
has passed. “I’ll come back to this when I’m older, I guess.” I do not want to
use too much of my precious ingredients for experiments anyway, and there might
be a book somewhere on why my attempts did not work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
am sure that I will eventually find out where I went wrong and record a more
efficient method in a notebook, meaning that there <b><i>should</i></b> be such
a book in this vast library, considering the fact that they are from the future.
Also, why does this awesome storehouse of knowledge not have a catalogue? I
want to ask Miss Breezy about it but…I am – I yawn – very tired. My brain is
squeezed out like a crushed lime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Onwards
to dinner, then to bed.” Miss Breezy instructs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“But…”
But such a passion for this subject might not return tomorrow. Not like passion
and curiosity can do much without proficiency. But…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“We
will do the combat training again tomorrow, I promise, so for that you must
have a good rest.” She sounds heavenlier than ever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
so I agree, and we take the walk out of the forest together like always. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
guess I need to deal with the lack of accomplishment from time to time, despite
the high productivity of the day. It is not that I truly believe I have not
accomplished much today, but I am still feeling quite deflated. However, I <b><i>will</i></b>
succeed, either later or very later, that fact is insured at least, so all I
need to do is keep trying. That, I can say, is one of the advantages only I
possess.</span></p>
