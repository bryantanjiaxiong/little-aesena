<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
sun is at the height of day. There is only one. It glares intensely, and I have
to hide under a tree for shade. I look back down. Everywhere is sand, and sand
is everywhere. These trees are on sand, those trees are on sand, and I am on
sand. And it is bizarre how the roots are behaving exactly as they would have
in proper dirt, keeping the trees steady and upright.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
is hilarious how one only realises that one still has tons of questions after
it becomes too late to ask them. I literally jumped without thinking. ‘Jumped’.
Jumped. It does not matter. What really matters is…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What
‘fun meeting’? And with who? How do I look for this man…or woman? Or…God? Maybe
the Being Of Time? When do I need to conjure the next Timegate to bring me over
to the year 477? How long do I stay in the year 331? What do I do here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
is too late now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
readjust my cloak, stepping out into the heat again, heading forward to what
looks to be a huge excavation site. I look back to the small pack of trees, to
the middle of it where the Timegate ‘jumped’ me out. The gate has disappeared,
leaving behind the peace of the isolated greenery and a very disoriented me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If
not for the metallic sound of hammers on nails and stones ringing through the
air, I would not have known that there is a giant hole in the middle of the
desert. It would have looked like a flat plain desert otherwise, and I would be
in deep trouble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
might even believe that if the hammering halts and if I shut my eyes for a long
moment, I would open them to find myself in a very flat desert again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
stop before the large dip in terrain. Excavation…Ancient artifacts and
forbidden sites…Maybe this <b><i>is</i></b> a gathering of time-travellers.
Maybe they are preparing some kind of initiation ritual for me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
the people here seem ordinary. Their skin is dark and they are each wearing silver-coloured
helmets, and well, the only thing they are preparing for is a year-long
project, it seems. Pavilion tents are stood up here and there, and brick sheds
litter the perimeter. In the middle, there is what looks to be a temple peeking
out of the ground. Pillar and ladders ornament it, and on them a few people are
examining the tip of the temple, writing on something in their hands. On the
other side, diggers are safely continuing their work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There
are children too. I watch as three of them run to two men who are busy carrying
a loose pyramid of bricks between them, but the little ones are pestering them
for something. Then the children are each handed a single brick, and they join
the adults in walking over to a construction site, seemingly content with their
workload. A woman with a pot under an arm then comes over, takes away their
bricks and shoos them away, and the men laugh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
cannot help but smile at the scene. Bored kids are difficult to satisfy. I was
recently a bored kid too. Before…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What
should I do, though? Should I go down? I <b><i>am</i></b> guaranteed a fun
meeting…but would these people welcome a foreign stranger into their midst?
Yet, I am a little girl, so maybe they will. These people look to be of
Kaettlein-kind, but despite their complexion, their skins do not have the racial
Kaettlein dustiness. Maybe I am just too far away to see clearly. Are they just
dark-skinned Men? I will just keep watc-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Hm…Among
the people there is one fair-skinned participant: a young woman with her long
black hair tied up in a ponytail, a black stream that smoothly trails down to
just above her hips. Unlike everyone else, she is not wearing a helmet,
uncaring for her own safety. She dons a plain white baggy shirt, and long baggy
pants of brown which gets more of a dirt brown at her legs. She definitely
stands out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Standing
back up from bending over to look at something, she exchanges words with those
same children I saw, then after they run off she uses a sleeve to wipe off the
sweat on her forehead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
our golden eyes meet. Instantly I recognise her. How could I not? A little
shorter in height – well, not exactly <b><i>a little</i></b> – and she would be
the spitting image of my reflection. She smiles, probably recognising me too,
then she waves to me, goes over to a table to pick a satchel up before starting
to come over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>As
she uses her Screen Abilities to make platforms in the air in order to elevate
herself up to where I am, I keep my eyes on her, dumbfounded. She hops off the
last platform, which fades the moment her feet leave it, and reaches me. She calls
a large Screen on top of the both of us, letting it act as a shade against the
sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Hello,”
she greets, keeping her distance, not wanting to alarm me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
I already know what is going on, ‘a fun meeting’, so…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Hello,”
I greet her in return.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
silence falls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then
I pick my voice back up. “You’re beautiful,” I say. She <b><i>is</i></b>
stunningly gorgeous, and her worker’s outfit does not diminish that fact at
all. And she has a strong presence about her, a strong <b><i>Magical</i></b>
presence. The whole world seems to gravitate towards her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“And
you’re adorable!” She breaks into a wide smile then, and of course I smile in
return. She is even more beautiful when she smiles. “Aesena Varinas.” She
extends a hand to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
huff out a giggle before taking it. “Aesena Varinas,” I introduce myself in
turn. Then we erupt into a fit of giggles, still shaking hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“How
are you feeling?” She puts her hand back on her waist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Wouldn’t
you know?” I quip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It
just seems like the question to ask, you know. You’re on your first mission in
a faraway time. I would know.” She cannot stop smiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
cannot too, of course. Of course. Of course. It is like this joyful sensation
cannot be held back, plastering on my face a permanent grin. “I…should have
seen this coming.” Of course. This situation should have been so obvious. Miss
Breezy must have been aware about this too. Of course!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
would know,” she admits. And we erupt in another series of giggles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“How
long do I stay here?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Only
for a short while. Less than hour. Probably twenty minutes.” She looks to the
excavation site as the wind blows strands of hair from her face. She is <b><i>incredibly</i></b>
beautiful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Is
that so? I thought you would give me some kind of training or…or something like
a lesson or something.” Is this literally just a fun meeting then? Well, not ‘<b><i>just</i></b>’,
but, it could be more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
turns back to me with her eyes widened. “Disappointing, right? Very! I felt the
same back then too. Can’t do anything about it, though.” She spreads her hands
out, the satchel swinging. “Oh yeah. There’s more to our little chat, actually.
Kind of a delivery from me.” She reaches into it and takes two books out before
handing them to me. “The index of the library and a summary of
time-travelling.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Oh!
Wow, cool!” Gold!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
must be missing this, but it’s for good reasons that you’re only given them
now. Reasons that…,” she trails off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Reasons
that I’ll find out myself,” I finish for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Yup.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Did
you, um…Have you conjured the library yet? The log-and-rock and the endless
forest?” How powerful is she? “In the past?” I add as an elaboration. I did not
need to, of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“No,
not yet. I think I’m still a few years from that. But I’m heading back there
too, after this mission. It’ll become a bit more different through the years.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Something
tells me I should not ask what she meant by ‘different’. Details, details. “How’s
Miss Breezy?” I ask instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“My
very best friend. I can’t wait to tell her about how adorable you are!” She
smooths her fingers through my hair, and I giggle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Can
I ask about the manor too? But…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“How-how
old are you?” I wonder if that question sounds rude, but it could not be so.
She would know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
shows me two fingers, wiggling it. “Twenty-two in a few months.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah,
it is the month of Ulsa for her, three months from Oscy. Oh, wait, that is not
right; this is not her time. This situation has dizzed me a little. But anyway,
twenty-two is a bit too far into the future. “Are you already this beautiful at
sixteen?” I feel impatient.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
huffs. “Maybe. But you shouldn’t chase adulthood. At least not with too much of
a sprint. If I could, I would have held onto my cuteness a little longer.
Though, it’s not every day that I get called ‘beautiful’ by myself.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
blush. Then…“Are there any dan-” I stop myself just in time. ‘Are there any
dangerous missions that I should look out for?’ and maybe even ‘Will I meet any
trouble in this first mission?’. Details…Details about the future should be
avoided.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
has already been through many time-travelling missions, meaning that she knows
how dangerous some of them might be. But I myself do not know that yet, and
that is a huge difference. Once she tells me, I would then <b><i>know</i></b>,
and then those dangers would become unavoidable. It is not like the dangers are
avoidable now, but…at least I do not <b><i>know</i></b> they are coming my way.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
is like the Coloured Square Effect. The Ball-In-The-Box Effect in the movies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Also,
if I had asked those questions, many memories might surface in her mind, and
she would recall those dangers even if she decides not to inform me of them.
Then, in a similar way, those dangers would be fixed onto the timeline, unavoidable,
inevitable, simply because they exist in her memory, indelible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
notices, of course. Of course she does. “My turn for a question, if I may?” And
I nod, blushing again as I realise the amount of questions I have thrown her
way, though I still have so many more. “What are the pros and cons of our duty?
Not ‘<b><i>cons</i></b>’, per se, but…you know?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod again. “I know.” ‘Things we must avoid’, she means. Something like that…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
structure my answer: “We have a total guarantee that our life has purpose, and
that the destination we’re heading to is actually <b><i>somewhere</i></b>. We
know, that in the end, we will find some kind of success, no matter what.” I
pause for a breath, one in then one out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
breathe in again. “But on the other hand, we can never ask how, because we
shouldn’t. We must wait for the ‘how’s to come to us themselves. We must wait
for our life to find its own way, just like everyone else, though they don’t
have our impulsive urges.” Urges which I will have, urges which I must supress.
“We cannot ask for a guidebook, like…like fortune tellers, because then our
fixed timelines will be…even more fixed?” It does make sense, though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
gives me a look of approval, then her golden eyes turn solemn, though she is
still wearing a smile. “Yes, never submit to a seer’s demands. Their Magic to
see into the future is a direct counter to ours.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
want to ask if she has ever experienced having her future read by a seer, but I
know better. I think I understand most of the time-travelling algorithm now. The
journal is without much details for the same reason. Did I not say a similar
thing that day? That day I learnt of my duty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Ignorance
is bliss in this particular case,” she continues, “Ours.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Yes,”
I agree.</span></p>

can’t believe I was so cute <b><i>and</i></b> intelligent,” she remarks, “Only
twelve and already as wise as a thousand.” She is exaggerating, and I laugh at
that.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You

of set diagram. Then I remember reading about it: old clocks that use circles
instead of sticks as their hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Your
insignia,” she explains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Woah.
“A trademark…Like…copyright?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
laughs. “Yes. Like copyright.” She reaches into her collar and shows me her own
pendant. “See? The very same.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Thank
you,” I am filling up with bubbling confidence, “I must make another one in
preparation of your today, then?” Words get a little tongue-twisty whenever the
topic of time-travelling is being discussed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Not
very soon, but you’ll find out,” she assures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
tuck the pendant into my cloak. “Is it about time…now?” I wonder if I will ever
get to meet my future-self again. And again, I cannot ask. But maybe…No, never
mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
think so. My mission here in this period is this meeting with you, and helping
them solve the mystery of this ancient monument. The Shaping brought a lot of
strange stuff into the world.” She gestures to the excavation site.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
tilt my head. “The…Shaping?” I have never heard that term before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Oh,
The Shifted Heavens Phase. ‘S-H-P’, therefore ‘Shaping’, see? It’s a slang that
became widespread on the media. Also, you know, the re-<b><i>shaping</i></b> of
reality and all,” she explains, then our golden eyes meet again, “Your timeline
is not there yet.” She laughs, and I ponder on the information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
moment after, her expression changes. “Anyway…are you scared?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
smile. “Definitely.” I would be incompetent if I am not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Her
eyes gleam. “Have faith in your personality, and you’ll always turn out more
than fine.” She places a hand on my shoulder, then she backs away, and the
Screen above us dematerialises. “I’ll take a step back now, and-”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Do
you still use ‘Yippa’?” It is a random question, but I just want to know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
briefly looks at me with a confused expression, her mouth opening a little and her
head slightly tilted, before she bursts out in laughter. “Oh my, wow, I really
forgot about that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Forgot’?
What doe-Then I get it. Oh…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘No
matter what’, the phrase rings true no matter what. The question escaped her
memory of my today, but I still want to try it myself though I know I will also
fail. I will remember to note this down later. Keyword: ‘Yippa’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
produces a bracelet from her left sleeve, a mere string of dark blue, and
hanging from it is a seemingly very normal grey pebble, but I recognise it, my
fingers feeling my own pebble in my own pocket. “My lucky charm.” She unlatches
the pebble from the bracelet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“And
here you will learn from me the Throwing Spell.” She grins at my eyebrows being
raised. “You haven’t heard of it, no doubt; I made it up for my leisure hours.
You can actually do almost anything with your mags. Here, watch.” She lifts the
pebble to her lips, detachedly whispers: “<b><i>Hohoho</i></b>,” then she
swings her fist backwards, gathering momentum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
start to protest, but the pebble is shot off into the sky with the hurling
speed of a catapult. Then in the distance, it shines, and the farther it goes
the faster it shimmers, like a blinking star on the endlessness of this desert
that is so laid out like a blank canvas. I am struck speechless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“<b><i>Yippa</i></b>,”
she calls. And in a split three seconds, the shine slows and disappears and
then she snatches the pebble from the air. “Does that answer your question? You
can keep doing it, repeatedly. A rocking way to pass the time, right?” She
looks at me expectantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look down at my own pebble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
becomes alert. “No, no, no. Don’t do it yet. Not here and not now,” she
giggles, closing her hands over mine. “Honest opinion here, but your skills are
still immature. Hone them and then try it yourself, okay? I usually do this on cliffs
where I can just sit and see it blink away like shooting star. Okay?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Okay,”
I cannot keep the smile off my face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Here,
give me your hand and the pebble.” And when I do, she makes a motion with her
fingers, and a blue string wraps itself around my wrist, on it a silver latch.
She clips the pebble onto it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
know what you’re thinking,” she steps back, “that you’ll not forget to do such
a thing to your younger-self when you meet her a decade later. But you will.
You will forget just like I did.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“No
matter what?” Of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
smiles back, then she gestures at the desert. “You can still try, because I
did.” We share a little laugh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
is time. And without thinking, I wave a hand, and from nowhere springs the
mirror-like Timegate. It is as if the graphics of this reality suddenly
glitches before a hidden feature manifests itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It’s
very nice meeting you, Aesena Varinas,” she bids me farewell, and her eyes are
filled with a longing I do not understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
feel the same, Aesena Varinas,” I respond in kind. It does not feel strange at
all, which is a strange fact ironically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We
wave at each other, and then I step through the gate. And I wonder if I am
repeating the same mistake of not asking all of my questions. But the Timegate
swallows me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What
greets me on the other side is a lush green jungle. Dry mud cakes the ground,
with bushes of fern and wildflowers sprouting out like toppings. Trees loom
mightily, though not as mightily as the trees in the forest back at home; these
trees are more densely crowded, putting me in a sinister atmosphere, as if I am
being pressed down by the heavy greens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Through
an opening in the leaves above my head, I marvel at the distant heights of The
Essarian Mountains, their peaks crowned by clouds and mists. The peak of Mount
Terra looks the very same even though I am fifteen centuries into the past, a
huge spike that protrudes into the sky, one much higher than its peers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
hear a river, and when I listen more closely, I hear the neighing of horses and
the sound of wooden wheels grinding the ground. I turn around, seeing pillars
of black smoke reaching into the sky, smoke from a dozen campfires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
pull my cloak tighter around me, then check if my Magic Bag is by my side, then
check if the bracelet with the pebble is around my wrist. I breathe in. Then I
breathe out. Then I breathe in. I smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So
it begins!</span></p>
