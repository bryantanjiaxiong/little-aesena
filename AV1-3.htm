is creeping down the trees on the illuminated side, but I still cannot see the
suns yet, though I know it is already midday. I probably should have brought a
watch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
swallow. “Yes, please answer that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Breezy’
makes a funny sound. “I cannot, at least not yet. Other questions first.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then
why did she even address the question? I squint at the air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Yes.”
I take another bite, this time a small one. “Not a forest spirit, not a wind
spirit,” my eyes widen, “are you the pebble?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Goodness,
child.” She sounds amused. “Does the name ‘Breezy’ not mean anything?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
totally forgot to regard that in the possibility I just came up with. “By the
way, are you serious with that name? ‘Breezy’? You won’t tell me your real
name?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
huffs. “Again, I didn’t say it wasn’t real. But it’s not my <b><i>real</i></b>
real name. ‘Breezy’ will do, for now.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
shall address you as ‘<b><i>Miss</i></b> Breezy’ then.” I guess Magical Beings
have more than one name. Or it could be a nickname given by another Magical
Being. “Well…what are you?” I go back to the question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
am a voice. Just a voice.” Miss Breezy reveals, ‘breezing’ around me, though I
notice that the blades of grass do not flow along with her ‘movements’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
voice? I take a bite. A voice…with a presence? That would explain the ‘core’
talk too. Hm…“Do I have it right if I say that you came into this world via
Magic?” I ask. What else can it be though?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Very
right. But don’t ask how. Maybe not yet. Long story.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There
are a lot of ‘not yet’s floating about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
turn to the depths of the forest, further into the dark-greenness, where there
is lesser sunshine piercing down through the canopy. “Is it the Magic of
Hawkwoods?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“No.
Contrary to what you might believe, Hawkwoods is still far away. It has its own
heavy presence that you’ve definitely not felt before.” She pauses, and I feel
observed. “I’m relieved that you feel more at ease now. So…next question:” She
turns. Well, she ‘turns’. “‘What is that pebble?’”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod. “What is that blue light?” I elaborate my bewilderment on the main factor
that led me into these woods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Nothing
really. It’s just a pebble.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
remain in my thoughts, not quite registering what Breezy just said, but when my
mind finally reaches it, my bewilderment is intensified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“W-what
do you mean?” I shake my head, incredulous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Exactly
what you heard. It <b><i>is</i></b> Magiced, but it’s nothing more than that.
Just a simple Magic stone that…does nothing but flash, actually.” There is no
mocking tone in her voice. Instead, she sounds rather apologetic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
adjust my sitting position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It’s
<b><i>that</i></b> random? But like…who placed it there? Why did its flashing
grow slower the nearer I got to it? Why is it the only pebble in these woods?”
I look around to make sure there are no other pebbles in sight. “Why is the log
and the rock positioned in the middle of this clearing? It looks purposely
designed to be like that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy remains quiet as I launch my barrage of questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
compose myself, realising that my sausage roll is gone. I try to look for it
before deducing that I have actually finished eating it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Why?”
I do not know why I asked that nor the answer I am seeking. I move to pick the
pebble up, and it does feel like a normal one between my fingers. “Why?” I ask
again, probably at the stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
still have buttercakes,” she reminds me, and I go over to take them out of the
basket, then plop myself back down on the rock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Why
have I not seen it shine before? This is my third time on a picnic after all.”
I found my question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Maybe
you weren’t as observant as you were today. Maybe you sat on a different side
of the tree. Maybe more heavier things were on your mind. Who knows exactly?
The truth we know is that you came for the blue light today,” Miss Breezy
reasons. “But I have actually been flipping a lot of coins lately.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
ponder on her last line. “For us to meet, which we must, but for reasons you
don’t feel ready to reveal yet.” I put my thoughts into words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“They
will be a lot for you to take in, which you very soon will. For the moment, a
good chat shall suffice.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>One
by one, I pop the buttercakes into my mouth. And soon the plate is empty again.
Then I lean back onto the log, putting my head on it, looking up to the canopy.
Suddenly, I feel tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘A
lot to take in’, huh? “This is already the most interesting thing that has ever
happened to me in my entire life. I wonder why I don’t doubt it as real. It
could very well be a mere dream.” I could have dozed off under my tree, and
maybe that is why I have not noticed the blue light before, because there is no
actual blue light. My composure seems too steady too, considering the
situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
would only know when you wake up. But when in a dream, go as far as you can as
long as you can.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy is right. If I wake up from this now, I would have hoped for it to have
gone on a little bit longer, just to know what is up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>With
the gaps between the leaves, the canopy above allows me to imagine a green
window being cracked, light spilling through it. Maybe someone punched a fist
through the glass, which would account for the big hole where the clearing lies
beneath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Why
are these woods so strange?” I keep my gaze upwards. I do not know why I feel
that it is strange. It is just…unexplainably so. Some factors are a little
explainable though: “I heard birds for a while, but then they’re gone. And
there is not a single fly or woodbug around. The grass around the trees
shouldn’t have looked so well-tended, but they are. Does Grandmama’s household
come in here regularly?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“There
are no fallen logs anywhere but this one right here, <b><i>right</i></b> in the
<b><i>middle</i></b> of a clearing. Tell me that isn’t the strangest thing
ever.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy is in her silence again, though this time I think she is allowing me
more time to think. But the answer is not that difficult to find, of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“There’s
Magic. Either Magic built this forest or Magic transformed it into such a
place, where only the trees grow taller without any intrusion.” I caress my
cheek with my hand. “And this log-and-rock formation is placed deliberately, as
I suggested. So is the pebble. Somehow. Whatever for, though?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Will
you come back tomorrow?” Miss Breezy asks suddenly. “It seems you’ve finished
your food, and by your eyes I notice that you’re growing sleepy. Your questions
might not have been exhausted yet, I am aware, but you are.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
guess I am. I rub my eyes, sitting up. I have had too much excitement, and it
looks like I am at my productivity limit today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
wish to show you something, but you’ll need to have a clear and alert mind for
that. Nothing dangerous, just interesting. And fascinating. I’ll wait for you
right here,” she assures me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
stand. “Can’t you follow me back to my room? We can talk there.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Alas,
child, I’m not just in your head. Everyone would hear me if I speak to you in
front of company.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Hm…“I’m
supposed to ask Miss Alice out on my next picnic. Maybe she’ll be busy again.
Or I can come after I finish up with her.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Anything
will do.” Miss Breezy sounds bubbly, almost like she is prancing around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look down at the pebble in my hand, this plain grey stone. “Can I take this
back with me?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Of
course. I don’t think it’ll play a big role in anything, however bright it
flashes. But some normal things can still be cherished,” she advises. I observe
that Miss Breezy loves to preach, though I guess that is everyone around me. I
am but a child after all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It
<b><i>will</i></b> be cherished. It will be proof that our meeting happened,
and it’ll hold the memory of it too, signalling good things to come, am I
right?” I smile at the air, in the direction of where I think Miss Breezy is.
It will be so weird to her if I am not actually facing her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
have earned a keepsake today. It is just a pebble, but in many ways I know I am
content with how the day turned out. My mouth suddenly opens and releases a
yawn, and I hurry to cover it. I blink back my tears and stretch my arms
outwards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“The
woods won’t change on my way out, will they?” It is an unnecessary question.
“Can you accompany me out? Only till they end.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Come
then, child.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
tuck everything into my basket and pick it up, setting out in the direction
where I came from. But though I did note the direction the basket was pointing
in, I still doubt myself. I am glad I found Miss Breezy here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now
that I pay more attention to the giant trees and the canopy roof they support
and how in each direction except backwards the woods do not seem to end, I
realise the absolute beauty the picture they put together conjures. With less
care for my safety and quietness then just now, I can appreciate them as they
are. But soon the sun greets me, and I am out of the woods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It
was a pleasure to meet you, Aesena Varinas.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
turn and curtsy. “I feel the same, Miss Breezy.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
will guide you in the next time you’re here, so don’t worry.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
I nod and wave before walking off, passing my tree and down the hill. Finally
nearing the sidegate, I run down the remainder of the hill, the way I like to
do, but this time stopping myself before I could crash into the hedges. I do
not want to trouble Mister Martin again. Before turning around a corner, I look
back to the woods, and I know Miss Breezy is still watching, so I wave one last
time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
skip through the gates, noticing two figures by the bell on the tower, leaning
over something one of them is holding. A book, most probably. One of them has
Miss Violet’s general posture, so I call: “Miss Violet!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
figure turns, and her bright blonde hair proves me right. Behind her, now that
I see more closely, is Miss Alice, whose hair is a darker shade of gold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’re
back, young Aesena!” Miss Alice leans out of the railing, as dangerously as she
did this morning. “Leave your basket at the table, I will tend to it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
can wash the plates myself!” I increase my voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“No,
no, let us do it. I’m coming down now.” And with that, Miss Alice disappears
from sight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Go
take a shower, my lady,” Miss Violet says, and disappears too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So
I enter the house, and as I was told to do, leaves the basket on the dining
table before heading up the stairs and into my bathroom. Too tired for a long
wash, I decide that a quick rinse will do, but under the splashing of the water,
I find that I can just stand like that for hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
wonder how Grandmama would react if I tell her about the log and the rock and
the flashing pebble. The pebble! I almost jumped before remembering that I just
placed it on my desk. I sigh in relief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Maybe
Miss Alice will like to have a look at it, or Mister Martin. Miss Emilia might
know a few forest legends too. Actually, everyone would probably have much to
tell me about the subject if I show them the pebble’s Magic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
I do not think I should have entered the woods in the first place, though they
did say that the area around the manor is safe. If they hear about me
discovering something Magical, they would most likely not allow me to go out
alone again. At least, I think that would be Dada’s and Mama’s reaction, since I
did wander pretty deep into those woods. That <b><i>was</i></b> irresponsible
of me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yet
there is an incredible urge in me to share the story at dinner later. Perhaps everyone
just might commend me on such an adventure. Miss Breezy did not warn me against
telling anyone about the experience too. Hm, I wonder why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Since
she wants to show something to me tomorrow. I guess I will decide after that.
How much of the story should I tell then? Ah, these thoughts can wait after a
nap. I close the tap and exit the bathroom, simply putting on a baggy dress and
jump onto my bed, forgetting again to experiment if I can be conscious enough
at the end of counting myself to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
wake with the ring of the dinnerbell, and give my room a loud yawn. Upon seeing
the pebble despite the falling gloom, I recall my excitement. The day was not a
dream at all. Indeed, it is very real. I jump out of my bed and into the
corridor, down the stairs and into the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Good
evening, everybody.” I spin on arrival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Careful,
young miss.” Miss Emilia puts on a frown. “Don’t run in such a long dress. You
might slip.” Then she smiles, putting her hands onto my shoulders and guiding
me to a chair. “Do you remember the dish you said was ‘spectacularly superb’?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>My
eyes widen with joy, and I clap thrice, rubbing my hands together, for in front
of me is a large plate of Miss Alice’s and Miss Emilia’s white-sauce curry
chicken. The smell of grounded milkbuds immediately wakes my senses to the
fullest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“A
little surprise to repay the morning you gave us. Sorry for not calling you to
join in our cooking though. You were sleeping so soundly; I didn’t wish to
disturb you.” Miss Alice lays out bowls of rice around the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Aw,
but I do so want to learn this dish. “It’s okay. Thank you so much. I can’t
wait. Oh, quickly everyone, please sit.” I give Grandmama a hug before sitting
down beside her, and Miss Violet pours the sauce onto my rice. I can feel
myself beaming. What good food to tell a story over. A story…Oh no, I have not
decided on what to tell yet, and they will soon ask.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
the meal starts with Miss Emilia complimenting Mister Martin about the milkbuds
he grew, which ends in an applause from the table. Then Miss Violet tells us of
how she asked for the best chicken meat from the market this morning, and how
she reached the best deal for it, and we laugh and clap for her too. Then
Grandmama comments on the perfection of the dish, saying: ‘spiciness and sweetness
are mixed to a delight!’, and this time I start the applause for Miss Alice and
Miss Emilia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Finally,
my turn comes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“How
was your day, Aesy?” Grandmama asks, and I just know how I am going to start.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Miss
Alice prepared for me a wonderful picnic, with bread and bacon and cheese and
buttercakes!” I spread my hands out. “And in the middle of my outing, I saw a
bright blue light flashing deep inside the woods. You know, the one behind the
left gate.” I point, wondering for a moment if I am pointing in the right
direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“A
blue light? You didn’t enter the woods, did you?” Mister Martin has a worried
expression, and I know at once that I should say no more than that for tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“No,”
a straightforward lie, “but I <b><i>did</i></b> want to do so badly. It kept
flashing, like it’s urging me to,” I gesture as I describe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Those
woods are very mysterious. You did well to not go for the light alone, young
Aesena. Maybe I can follow you next time.” Miss Alice offers, bringing to her
mouth a spoonful of the curry and then swallowing. “It will be a great
adventure, don’t you think? ‘The Mystery Of The Blue Flash’.” She giggles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I’m
going out for another picnic tomorrow, to see if it’s still there. It might
still be flashing even now.” It is not, of course, at least not in the woods. I
wonder if the cars on the road can see a blue flash from my room through the
window. “Are you free tomorrow?” I ask Miss Alice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
will be taking Alice out in the morning,” Miss Emilia raises her hand, “We
won’t be back till dinner.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Oh?
Where to?” Mister Martin stands up to refill his bowl with curry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Alice puts her arm around Miss Emilia. “Emilia has been pestering me for days
about a birdshow coming to town. Thought I could accompany her. Are you fine
with that, young Aesena?” She looks to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod. “Of course. I might still need help preparing a basket though.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Violet turns to me with a smile, which I feel myself naturally returning. “I’ll
do it this time,” she says, and I smile wider.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Grandmama
puts a hand on mine. “I would have gone for the light,” she whispers, winking
as she goes back to her food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
table resumes to other subjects as I listen in: a silverling that has laid
three eggs, a bush of starclovers that is starting to sparkle, a new musical
composition, an update on the passing of the Butterfly Comet, and so on. Through
all that, I keep smiling to myself as I repeat Grandmama’s words in my head
amidst my enjoyment of the hearty meal.</span></p>
