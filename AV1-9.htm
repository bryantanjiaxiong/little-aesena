<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Tomorrow
is the day. Tomorrow is the day. I keep repeating it as I wait for sleep to
take me, but it does not. My heart is pounding like drums at a festival, my
blood flowing rapid and hot like a river of liquid fire. The blanket feels like
a bother at times, and at other moments it is as if the bedsheet itself is made
out of needles. Tomorrow is the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
wait. I squint at the window, the curtains gently rippling. The sun is up
already! A brightening dawn, with the red just beginning to fade into an
orange, but the morning nonetheless. I sit up agitatedly, rocking the bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Today
is the day! If my soul could leak out onto the floor it very surely would. I
have missed the opportunity to savour the comfort of my feathery bed for the
last time before what is to come, and have instead squandered it away because
of my restlessness. I wonder if I have actually slept at all, and have not
merely been <b><i>trying</i></b> to the entire night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Never
mind that. It will be a week before I can take a proper shower again. If I do
not take one now, I will be sure to regret it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then
as I stumble into a knee-length dress, I hear the sound of the piano. The manor
has woken up. And that gives me an idea: to start the day like I started that
one day when everything started; a fitting routine. I head down to the
kitchens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
ready six mugs, one of them Grandmama’s dark red one, and gather up the
ingredients on a tray. My hands are quicker now, I consciously notice, as one
hand swipes redseeds and moonlaces off the tray to add into the brew while the
other stirs. All that practice from potion-making, no doubt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Potions…did
I properly prepare those that I might need? I will have to check later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
focus on the moment’s task: eight spoonsful of blackapple syrup and nice
redseeds for Miss Alice, icefoam and four spoonsful of syrup for Miss Emilia,
two fingers of moonlaces for Miss Violet, and since today is not Tasday Mister
Martin’s should be hot with three crunches of wakingleaves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“<b><i>Ellamisceo</i></b>,”
I whisper, and tiny whirlpools are formed in all four cups, stirring the
mixture Magically, and as they do, I carefully pour winddust into each of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
ponder on Grandmama’s cup. How did I do it last time? Hm…today’s mood then.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
finger-long moonlace, six redseeds, six spoonsful of the syrup, two pinches of
wakingleaves…That should be perfect! I will use the same measurement for my own
cup, like how I usually asked for. “<b><i>Ellamisceo</i></b>,” I call again
after adding hot water to both Grandmama’s cup and mine, slowly tipping the
container of winddust towards them one by one, watching as every sprinkle melts
instantly. It gives off an extremely satisfying sensation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look out the window to let the morning into my eyes, keeping my sight on the gleaming
dewdrops on a glazetilly shrub for a long moment, reluctant to turn away,
wanting to continue gazing blankly, but I eventually return to my work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Finally,
with all the cups filled and neatly arrayed on the tray, I add the one
ingredient I did not have the chance to use the three times before today:
honeyhangs. Two petals each except for Miss Alice’s and Mister Martin’s, both
who would prefer the bitterness of their tea to remain strong, so I only put a
single petal onto theirs respectively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
wondered if I should have used the grinded powder of the honeyhang petals
instead, but that would have been too sweet for a waking morning. I pick up the
tray and exit the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Alice stops just in time as the both of us round the same corner. “Whoopsie-lasiely,”
she exclaims a little too loudly, then winces as she remembers the piano
playing in the background, and we giggle softly. “Good morning. I was just
about to come ready your picnic basket for you. It is a bit earlier today because
I have some errands to run in town with Miss Violet.” Then she notices the tray
in my hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Good
morning. The…” I count, “middle one of the row nearest to you, that one’s
yours. Do you usually use honeyhangs for your blackapple tea?” I want to make
sure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That’s
alright. I enjoy anything that you make, young Aesena,” she rubs my head,
“Thank you so much.” She picks her cup up and takes a sip, swooning adorably.
“What a start of a lovely day. Well, let me get to work. Come back in fifteen
minutes, okay?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Okay.”
‘A start of a lovely day’…My head spins for a while before I continue walking, then
up the stairs to the second floor. On my turning into the right corridor, I
look behind to the music room, all the way to the end of the manor’s left wing,
and I see the silhouettes of both Mister Martin and Miss Emilia leaning onto
the side of the piano as it plays. I cannot spot Miss Violet from where I
stand. I change directions, starting down the left corridor instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
stop at the doorway to quietly announce my presence before stepping in. But it
does not seem necessary for me to retain my careful silence. Mister Martin and
Miss Emilia are chatting in a casual volume, and Miss Violet with her graceful
and composed demeanour does not seem to mind them as her fingers dance across
the piano keys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
feeling engulfs me: how during my mission I will miss her music lessons so, so
much. I shake it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Good
morning, young miss. Up so early again.” The room has a long column of windows,
some opened and some not, and in the glare of the sunlight they allow in, Miss
Emilia’s eyes sparkle a pure emerald green. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Violet looks up briefly from her piano to acknowledge me, her stunning seablue
eyes capturing me entirely in their hold, if only for a fleeting moment. Then
she nods and returns her focus to her fingers and the keys and the springily
upbeat melody.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
show them the tray. Mister Martin beams with a charming smile that befits his
gentle smiling eyes and faint facial hair that smilingly frames his face.
“Lucky day,” he announces. The windows in this room makes me notice everyone’s
eyes more, for some reason.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Indeed.”
Miss Emilia comes over to lift the tray from my hands and places them on a high
table beside an ornamental vase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So
now my hands are free to serve their respective cups to them. Miss Violet stops
the piece prematurely, but with enough grace that it somehow sounds completed,
and stands up from the piano, coming over as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Wonderful
as always, you and your brew, my lady,” she says after a sip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
curtsy to my tutors. “Happy to be of service.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
pick the tray back up, waving my goodbyes and trading best wishes for the day, to
continue on towards Grandmama’s room. I open the door with my elbow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Good
morning, Grandmama.” I relieve myself of the tray then extend the cup to
Grandmama.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>As
always, she is reading a book, this one titled ‘The Fifty-Night Roving’. She
wedges a bookmark in between the pages before closing it. “Aesy.” Grandmama
calls. “Ah, another special day has arrived.” She receives the cup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
take a seat down beside her, bringing my own cup to my face, letting the vapour
thinly plume upwards onto my face. I take in the smell of the blackapple tea,
redseeds and moonlaces and all. Then I drink, slowly because it is very hot. I
sigh softly, satisfied for the while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Grandmama
turns to me, her head leaned back. “The plan for the day?” I know it is a
question because we do this on a daily basis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
smile. “Adventure.” That is how I call my ‘picnics’, because they are not mere
picnics. And today will be far from being one. Today the word ‘adventure’ rings
true, like bells, bells that are sounding louder as each second passes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“This
book I’m reading is just about that. It’s quite the journey actually,” she
raises the book to show me the cover, “A sailor had to leave the sea for a
forest then a desert, both terrains that he was not suited to, to find and
deliver items. I’m at the part where he needed to return to his ship, and from
there sail to a remote island, then the path would still take him further outwards
into uncharted waters. All in fifty days.” She puts the book back down onto her
lap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’ve
read it before?” I lean against an armrest so that I am tilting in my seat in
her direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Yes.
Of course, he would reach home in the end, sit down by a warm fire with a hot
cup of something in his hand, and put down all his doings-and-goings on paper.
I think such adventures can be endlessly reread, as a sort of reflection.” Grandmama
is such a romantic. “I imagine that I am that sailor, reading the words that
I’ve myself written, vividly – but this time safely of course – experiencing all
that again. It’s a heavenly feeling that really fills me up.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
cannot help but widen my smile at that. I think of how, at the end of my
adventure, I will surely come home no matter what. I will be fine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>At
least my adventure is not the one lasting fifty days, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That’s
a lovely book review,” I remark, “I’ll have to borrow it for a read when you’re
done.” Did I say the same thing yesterday morning? That book was titled ‘By The
Sandy Grey Beaches’, if I remember correctly, a thinner novel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Of
course. By the end of today, you will.” Her golden eyes sparkle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
drink, then I stand. “Well, Miss Alice must be done by now. I’ll get going.” I
give Grandmama a hug and then a kiss on both cheeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Have
a great time, Aesy.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
too, Grandmama.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
back to the kitchens I go, where Miss Alice hands me my basket, the whole of it
filled with bacon-and-egg wraps, chicken sandwiches, clouds and sausages and
slices of carrot cake. There is also a small bottle of fruit milk. She walks me
to the gate then bids me a good day, and I return the wish, thanking her again
for the food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“See
if you can find any stars on the ground today, young Aesena!” She calls loudly
when I am halfway up the hill, and we share a laugh between our distance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then
halfway downhill, I double back. I look at the manor one more time, almost like
it is a dramatic final gaze. It is not, of course, I will return soon. Miss
Alice has already gone back inside. I look at the red towers and the red
mansion, the chimneys and the bell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Goodbye,
towers. Goodbye, mansion. Goodbye, chimneys. Goodbye, bell.” After a while, I
resume my walk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
soon I am in the library, leaning onto the back-supporter of the big red chair
while I munch on a chicken sandwich, surveying the things that I have prepared.
I try to keep myself from feeling too tensed, because that would surely make
Miss Breezy tensed herself. Of course, she is doing the same with me in
consideration. Tenseness is contagious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Self-knitted
baggy-and-raggy dresses are laid folded and stacked, various potions in small
spherical vials glint from the lights in the ceiling. Other than that, there
are: a bunch of maps and another bunch of noteslips, a silver dagger from the
training field, a ten-metre rope and a feathered sleepmat. I did find some
Conjuration scrolls that would give me some kind of meal if I ever need to open
them, and I am planning to bring three, just in case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>My
Magic Bag, also self-knitted, sits in the centre of it all, waiting to swallow
everything up. Floating by my side is my cloak, a dark crimson, also
self-knitted. With Magic, of course, and under Miss Breezy’s supervision.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy told me that it is best not to bring any suspiciously-modern items over
to the faraway past, for obvious reasons. No phones, no torchlights, no
firelighters, no canned food, no modern-style clothes, no sleeping bags and no
ballpens and the many like. I will be in for an authentic fifth-century
experience. Woohoo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

you stored your mags? There won’t be an abundance of it there like here in the
study.” Miss Breezy is holding back her voice. She wants to ensure I have
everything prepared without filling the question with…What word is most suitable
to define it? ‘Excitement’? ‘Worry’? ‘Anxiety’? ‘Anxiety’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Something
is stinging my heart. It is beating too quickly. Or too slowly. I do not know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Anyway,
how will this work?” How curious. After all that we have discussed, the topic
of how the time-jumping works has not yet been breached.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“When
you’re ready, when you feel you are, imagine a large mirror in an oval frame of
gold and silver.” Miss Breezy answers. “You do not need to know the details of
how this particular Conjuration works. Just think about it and it will come. It
cannot help but come.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
turn to my stuff. “<b><i>Saccusin</i></b>.” And everything takes turns hopping
into the Magic Bag. When it is the potions’ turn, I make sure to keep a count: five
Second Winds, five Higher Drives, five Senses Surges, three Senses Dimmings,
six Quick Minds, one Invisibility Potion and a few others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
head to the alchemy wing and take another Invisibility Potion. One more will not
hurt. I should be careful about using it though; its ingredients are listed as
rare. I throw the vial into the bag and it is chucked down with the other
contents. “<b><i>Yippa</i></b>,” I call, and the bag leaps into my arms, and I
sling it over me diagonally, like strapping on a pouch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
mirror, huh?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Do
I have any questions left that I need answers to right now, right before
everything?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Am
I ready?” I ask Miss Breezy, and I ask myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“More
ready than you’ll ever be,” she quips, and I notice the slight word change in
the common phrase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Clearing
my mind and picturing a mirror, I wave my hands at where my stuff was a minute
ago, and there before me springing-from-nowhere is an oval mirror twice my
height, rimmed with gold and silver. If I look closely, the glass swirls ever so
slightly, and on it my reflection ripples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Holy
golly woah.” I step backwards, the desk behind me supporting one of my hands as
the other clings onto the bag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Staring
at it now in its reflective splendour, I wonder if my present knowledge might prove
sufficient. The things I learnt about time-travelling do not add up to much,
since there is not a single book about it in the library, which is very
off-putting, but Miss Breezy told me that there should be a reason to it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
is probably like my destiny telling me not to worry and just go with what I
know, only letting me learn everything that is necessary to progress and then
to learn even more sooner or later. So I am not worrying. Or am I?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“The
gate will directly bring you to where you need to be,” Miss Breezy tells me,
her voice above me, I think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
thought speeds through my head. “You’ve seen this before. It is the same kind
of Timegate, right?” I ask her for reassurance, facing upwards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Yes,
just the way I remember it. It’s only been a while since I first saw it, so it’s
still a fresh memory.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
have another question, a funny one.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Ask
away.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
giggle. “By any chance, could you be the future me, painting yourself invisible
and flying around holding a microphone?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That
would be such a nice twist, wouldn’t it?” Miss Breezy laughs, an angelic sound.
“Good one, but…,” she laughs again, “But no, I’m just a voice.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
joke did its job. The atmosphere feels much lighter now. ‘A joke, well-placed,
no matter the situation, could clear up any fog of thoughts’, I read that
saying somewhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Thank
you, Miss Breezy, for all that we’ve been through together this past month.
Please don’t say it is because of your duty or my fixed timeline. You being
here means a lot. It changed my life, and maybe it <b><i>is</i></b> destiny, I
guess, but maybe it’s also…you know?” I cannot get past the first letter of
what I am trying to say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
know, Aesena Varinas,” she agrees warmly, “I am very glad to have been in your
company for the past month too. You’re brilliant beyond your imagination, and
your imagination is endless.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
blush at that, beaming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look up to the floating lights, then at the books that make the walls, then at
the desk and its wings. What a month. I take out the pebble from my pocket, the
blue shining pebble that is grey and un-shining now. I give it a good long
stare, then I close my fingers around it. What a month indeed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
will come back home soon, then I will make myself a hot cup of something,
probably honeyhung chocolate, and I will ask if everyone in the manor could
gather in the music room, and we will light the fireplace and just sit in each
other’s silence, like that one time we did before. It was on my third night
here, I think. I will start a diary too, one that refers to the time-travelling
journal. There are many other things I want to do. But for now…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
turn back to where I am sure Miss Breezy is. I can sense her uneasiness. But I
am calm, and now I think she is too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Year
331 first, right?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Right.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Right.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
breathe in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“See
you in a week,” I say, the hesitation in my tone before now gone without a trace
to be found.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“See
you in five minutes,” she says, a cheer in her tone, her worries dissipated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
turn to the gate. I step through it.</span></p>
