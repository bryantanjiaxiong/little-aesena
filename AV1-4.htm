style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
dance and twirl with the song in my head. The sun is surprisingly calm today
despite its early glare, bright but not too warm, entertaining my morning
stroll, and so I thank my luck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Jolly
mood today, Aesena Varinas,” Miss Breezy remarks, announcing her presence
before I could even think to wait for her outside the woods. She was the one
waiting instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
was jolly yesterday!” I remind her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
laughs lightly. “Jollier now. Good morning.”</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Good
morning, Miss Breezy. Shall we?” I skip into the forest, with Miss Breezy later
redirecting me a few steps to the right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
canopy appears to be healthier in a way too, like my mood, and I truly feel
that this day is blessed. There is still no chirping of birds or cricking of
insects as would have been easily heard in normal woods, however. I wonder if
my mind made up the chirps yesterday. A short while later, I am biting on my fifth
sandwich as I circle the log and the rock for probably the twentieth time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Everyone
said that the woods are dangerous, and that I shouldn’t go near them, but
Grandmama gave me a hint of her approval, as if she knew that I went for the
light.” I continue telling Miss Breezy about last night’s dinner between chews.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Hm?
What did she say?”</span></p>

said she would have done it, and well, she <b><i>did</i></b> tell me to go for
an adventure. Anyway, why do you think they said it’s dangerous?” Miss Alice or
Miss Emilia must surely have ventured into these woods before, only to have
found nothing interesting, save for the tall too-neatly-arranged trees and the
absence of anything else, both which…are actually very peculiar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“They
probably misunderstood the woods you are referring to. Though…you see, at the
entrance, ten-or-so more steps to the right or left and the woods might have
been dangerous,” Miss Breezy reveals. “And though once inside, these woods may
seem endless, it actually is, because it’s separated from your plane of reality.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Plane
of reality’? I almost laugh. The way she said it made it sound like it came out
of a movie. But…“Yes, I’ve actually thought about that possibility last night.
Fascinating!” This is almost like a different dimension, if it is not one.
Exhilarating! “That would mean that I could have gone really lost yesterday,” I
note.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
would have come for you if it had looked hopeless that you would find your own
way, or if you’d started to cry. But you’re smart.” Breezy is making me feel
observed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Is
that one of the sides to your coin?” I can feel her shrugging to that. “So the
blue light is intended for the person seeking it to come to it in one direction
from the spot of my tree…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Coincidentally.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
stop pacing. “Or not. Miss Breezy, I’ve been thinking about it, but all of this
somehow feels planned. Truly.” I gesture around the clearing with my sandwich.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Does
it now?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
stay quiet for two moments, musing on the situation. “What’re you wanting to show
me, by the way?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
‘breezes’ around me then comes to a halt by my side. “To be extremely honest
with you, I’m quite nervous about today.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Nervous’?
“So…” I trail off in confusion. “Are you going to let me see it?” I ask, a
little impatiently, then trying to compensate: “Or not?” I add.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Ha.
It’s meant to be anyway. Fine, come,” she urges, but I do not understand her
first line. “Hold out your hand to the log and the rock, Aesena Varinas, and
imagine them vanishing. In the same time, picture the woods shrinking into this
clearing.” Those are quite a few instructions to take in so quickly, but she is
not finished: “Imagine the sunrays melting with the leaves and the trunks of
the trees, and the green of the grass and the blue of the sky is woven together.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look at the unfinished sandwich in my hand, and she laughs upon noticing, a
bright giggle sounding around me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
apologise. I got too excited. Take your time, child, and I’ll wait,” she says.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
quickly pop the bread into my mouth, chew as quickly, and swallow it. “Alright,
can you repeat what you said?” I am so ready for something new.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Hold
a hand out.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
I do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Towards
the log and the rock and think about how they could possibly disappear into
thin air. Everything around you swirls into a single centre, and you’re in
somewhere else.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Somewhere
else’?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
I do. In my hurry, it is hard to imagine anything. Then suddenly I remember my
basket sitting on the ground before deciding that I should get this over with
first then maybe I can get to the basket later. I focus on the green and the
blue and the grey and the yellow and the brown, and the green and the grey and
the bl-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Woah!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
almost tripped backwards. The trees are gone and the canopy is gone and the
clearing is gone, and replacing them is a large room, with shelves of books
lining the walls around me, reaching up to the height of where the canopy roof
was. Replacing the spot where the log and the rock was is a long desk with
balls of light hovering above and around it. On it are piles of books, and also
scrolls and loose stacks of paper. In front of the desk is a big red chair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
am frozen, I realise, in disbelief, so I loosen myself up. However…woah. I did
expect being brought to some other place, but like, with butterflies and
singing flowers, or a meadow with dancing animals. This, I did not expect. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Floating
below the ceiling, which is the internal surface of a dome, are more lights of
varying bright colours. The ones at the desk are only a dim yellow. As I squint
harder, the spiral carvings etched onto the ceiling becomes clearer, constantly
shifting as if the ceiling is made of panels of display screens. But they are
not, for I know it is Magic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That
was fast,” Miss Breezy remarks in a giggly shock, and I turn to her voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Incredible!
“This is incredible! Where am I?” The books are the main attraction. The room
is sided by six walls, I count, making an equilateral hexagon, I think, and the
wallpaper might as well be the bindings of the books, as there is simply no gap
between the shelves. Some at the higher levels are not as filled as the ones
below them, I notice, with books that are slanting and stacking up steeply. I
start walking to one of the shelf-walls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Careful!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
pause at Miss Breezy’s warning, looking around, then down at the picnic basket
I almost kicked. Ha! It did follow me here after all, providing me with one
more factor to consider later when I am contemplating this…<b><i>wondrous</i></b>
Magic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
floor is made of polished wood, reflecting the lights so high above it. A
myriad of patterns swirls on, or within, the tiles, as if there is a river in each
of them. It is mesmerizing. I jump from tile to tile, watching as the swirls
disperse beneath my steps before reconverging where my foot leaves the surface.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Approaching
the books, I find that they are not at all dusty, though how could they be?
There are no windows in sight, but the room seems well-ventilated. Magic! No
doubt. But this is not the Magic I frequently heard nor know about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
woods I could deem as a Magical Happening, but the Magic in this room seems
more casual, and artificial, like the work of a wizard or a witch. Maybe it
does hide an artifact that an evil sorcerer desires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
reach for a book, bringing it off the shelf. The cover reads: ‘Red Series:
Caves Of Enbad’. I put it back, taking out another: ‘Year-dawn Stars’. It is a
little inconvenient, I opine, how the bindings themselves do not display the
title. It must be difficult for the owner of this place to find a specific book,
though maybe, again, Magic could easily solve that inconvenience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look for Miss Breezy, though of course I could not actually do that. “Miss Breezy,
where am I?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Hm…Well…How
do I put it?” She mutters. “This is your study,” she finally says.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
squint in confusion, not sure if I heard that right. “Come again?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
did tell you that things will be too much for you to take in too quickly. But let’s
begin: all of this is meant for you. Everything here.” Her voice bounces of the
shelf-walls of the room, resonating though not producing notably echoey
repetition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Everything
here’? “Everything here?” I look around again. “Prepared by whom?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“All
the answers must come in a particular order, to minimise the confusion. The
next thing I am supposed to tell you is: you’ll be learning all kinds of Magic
here, as you need to.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“‘Supposed
to-’, you’re <b><i>supposed</i></b> to tell me things? Wha-…I <b><i>need</i></b>
to learn Magic? Here…Like <b><i>here</i></b> here?” That explains the books,
though they do not look to have content about Magic. ‘Caves’ and ‘Stars’…Well,
there could be extra details…I cannot be sure. There are too many questions to
ask, so many such that waiting for Miss Breezy to slowly explain might be the
best choice to go down. “I’m only like…twelve,” I add. Things are happening too
fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Best
period to learn anything. Going on: you are a key figure in setting in motion
things that have already been set in motion.” Miss Breezy has a hint of
reluctance in this delivery, her voice faltering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
cannot help squinting again, this time also tilting my head. “What does that
mean?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’re
needed to make things that have already happened happen,” she clarifies, though
she actually just paraphrased what she previously said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
understood the first time, of course. “Time-travelling?” It is just getting a
little bit too unbelievable, this whole situation I am in right now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Kind
of. I mean, not kind of. Exactly.” Miss Breezy is speaking in a more serious
tone now, and it is clear now that she is nervous, which also makes me nervous.
“Some historical events have roles for you to play, even though the results were
already determined. You just need to be there, and do what you can, and things
will happen as precisely as they already have.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
stay silent, waiting for her to continue, because I really do not know what to
say for myself. I will just go along with this before thinking too much. I am
honestly too confused to do anything other than go along.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
continues: “Unsurprisingly, some events pose a huge amount of danger, which is
why you must learn Magic and other lanes of knowledge. All kinds of Magic; all
kinds of facts and details. To protect yourself and to come back to…your period
of time, which is this period. The books here would be your main source of
learning, but I’m also here as your guardian, though I cannot follow you
through your leaps through time.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Protect
myself? I try to keep myself composed. “But the results are set in stone.” And
I try to understand, repeating what I heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Yes.
On that table, clearly placed in the middle, is a diary of missions, a journal
of sorts, that contains each event you need to influence.” Her voice is still
jittery, a stark contrast from her characteristic heavenliness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
walk to the table, and indeed, there is a thin leather-bound notebook, which
actually looks new somehow. I open it, and the first page reads: ‘6<sup>th</sup>
The Ulsa, 331, Second Era’, and under it reads: ‘A quick fun meeting’. Then an
arrow points from the last letter to a second date: ‘19<sup>th</sup> The Eiine,
477, Second Era’, and under that reads: ‘Travel from Askenny to Isehr. Must
cross one mountain. Preparations needed, but not dangerous at all. One week’. A
red oval is drawn beside that entry, and in it is: ‘Use carriages, there will
be many. No cars. Haha’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Wow,
this looks serious! ‘Askenny’…That sounds like Ashcurn, which is a city I know
of. I think our car passed through it on our way to Grandmama’s. ‘Isehr’ rings
a bell too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
flip through the pages, and the entries do not end till every page but three
runs out. I estimate around two-hundred entries. That is <b><i>a lot</i></b> of
periods to jump to. Back to the first page, I notice another date at the very
top: ‘Go at The Year 2004 Anam The 23<sup>rd</sup> The Valvor’. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Go
at-’…this year? This is the date to jump into this mission. That is in a month!
It is so soon! My mind is bursting with thoughts as I try to keep up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
deliberate over what I have already been told. “Based on…Hm…With so many
entries, it’s…clear that I can never actually fail. Right? Because …they’re set
in stone…I’m meant to keep going and finish them all, so I’ll always end up
safe? But wait one more-” I realise something else, “is the last entry my last
one ever?” I inquire, keeping my eyes on the word ‘Haha’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“No,
further entries are simply not recorded here. I know for sure that you’ll <b><i>always</i></b>
be safe at the end of each…adventure.” Miss Breezy states confidently, with a
tone that sounds like she is hinting at something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“‘For
sure’? You’re that certain? Then there must be a solid reason behind that
certainty.” I ponder for a short moment before my eyes widen, and I realise
immediately, hurriedly flipping to the last page, but it is not what I am
seeking, though the theory in my head must definitely be true! It only makes
sense, however unbelievable it will still sound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
decide to voice my thoughts aloud. “<b><i>I</i></b> was the one that conjured
you. I mean, I <b><i>will</i></b> be the one to conjure you, but by going back
to the past…in the future.” My head swings at that last line, but I take her
silence as encouragement to theorise further. “That’s why I’ve never noticed
the blue flash, because it was only placed there recently. The entrance to the
Magical woods was just made too. By me? By my future self.” Wow, it really does
add up. “I’m feeling very clever now, please don’t tell me I’m wrong.” I huff
laughingly and nervously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’re
not wrong,” Miss Breezy responds without hesitation. “And I don’t think an
entry about that is in the journal.” She deduces the reason I flipped to the
last page so earnestly just now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“All
this…” I trail off, gazing at the ceiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Yes,”
she confirms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
will be a very powerful Magician to have created this ‘plane of reality’, and
such a marvellous one at that. I feel like I am in a dream, a dream with a plot
that is too well-structured, a dream that makes too much sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
shake my head from side to side languidly, incredulous. “This is a lot of information
to take in in five minutes.” I did wish for an interesting life here in
Grandmama’s manor, but this is a whole other level of ‘interesting’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“From
the start, you’re astoundingly good at deductions, a skill that will aid you in
many a quest.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I’m
only twelve,” I repeat the statement I made just now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“A
perfect age to kick off your saga.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
laugh then, at the total bizarreness of this whole reveal. “So I must make
‘necessary preparations’ before the twenty-third of next month. That includes
Magic lessons and research into the background of that period. Where’s
Askenny?” Again, I should have brought my phone out with me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
have tutors for History and Geography, I’m sure,” Miss Breezy points out, “Focus
on the fifth century of The Second Era for now, which I believe consists of
many important events around where modern Soria is. At the same time, <b><i>I</i></b>
will tutor you on Magic, and we’ll start the day after tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
might not have time for picnics once my classes start, though I am told that I can
make arrangements flexibly. Maybe I can make something work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What
ridiculous composure I possess! I look down at my palms. Maybe the disbelief
will seep in later, after I settle down or when I am lying in bed, but for now
I am excited for the many things that are coming. Too excited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
see that you’re exhilarated. Very surprising. I had expected you to be
more…shocked.” I sense an apologetic smile. “Forgive me for throwing all this
onto you so quickly, I’m trying my best.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’re
doing an amazing job, Miss Breezy, don’t worry. I…I got this.” Then I laugh
again. “And don’t get me wrong, I <b><i>am</i></b> shocked, but…also excited.
Anxious. Impressed, even.” I turn. “So the ‘coins’ you flipped, the ‘sides’
they are meant to ‘land’ on are already predetermined, and my arrival at the
clearing has already been arranged. Is it because of the first Aesena Varinas?”
I continue to theorise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
lets out a small chuckle. “What do you mean, child? You’re the one and only.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>How
could that be? “But what about the future me who set this stage? And…” I feel
my mind filling up again. “there is another ‘future me’ for my future me, and
so on. Aren’t there a million timelines then, supporting its own…‘past’?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
lot of movies I have watched before spring into my mind, crashing into my
thoughts like a waterfall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
guess that is an easy way to look at it, but it’s not the case.” I can sense
her shaking her head. Well…her ‘head’. “That ‘future you’ you mentioned is just
a gear to set this whole wheel into action, as you said: ‘set a stage’. The
only Aesena Varinas is the only Aesena Varinas, and soon you will find the best
way to explain that to yourself.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
do not get it. Not yet, at least. But one huge question is reeling me off my
patience: “That means…One day, I will be setting the stage for my past-self…” I
look around, “but how will I carry so many books?” I twirl, then-oh, I got it!
“Don’t answer that, sorry. Magic, of course.” What else? But…“What if I forgot
one of the books though, then the timeline…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Will
<b><i>not</i></b> change,” Miss Breezy cuts in. “Somehow, you won’t forget any
one of these books. To be concise…,” she hesitates, “your life is already set,
the things you will do already arranged. No matter what you do, things will
turn out the way they will, and there’s no avoiding nor changing them. You will
go through all that is written in that diary without a single difference, no
matter what.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>No
matter what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Her
tone turns reserved once more. “I understand how that might make your life seem
like a boring chore, since your future is fixed and unchangeable and you live
just to reach it, but-”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“But
the details are not certain.” I finish for her. “I mean, I do not yet know how to
achieve that destination, even though I know I will eventually be there.” That
also means my life has an…unbreakable insurance…and nothing can truly harm me
permanently. “It’s the adventure that is most important, I think, the
destination is just a guideline.” I read about something like that before. It
was a very good book, I think, though I cannot recall its title…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
becomes silent, and the room does too. “You haven’t changed at all,” she says
after a while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
giggle, understanding immediately. “I guess that makes sense, in a way.” I find
myself yawning. Why does information tire me so? I thought my energy would be
amped for such an adventure this is becoming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy notices. “I suppose you must first learn to exit this library. It’s the
same as when you came here.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
hold my hand out, picturing the clearing, and the walls of books blink to
become the tall trees, and the lights on the ceiling become sunlight shining
down through the canopy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That
was fun!” I skip about. “Anyway, I have a month, as that journal said.” I
should have brought it out with me. Oh well. “No matter what I do, I <b><i>will</i></b>
be prepared, right?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Very
right. So you <b><i>can</i></b> laze about and throw away precious hours of
learning as an experiment of whether or not you will actually turn out to be
prepared,” she suggests, “Yet I don’t think your excitement will allow that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Hm…“I
will test it out some other time, for sure, once I get the gist of how it
works. But to be honest, as you said, I can’t wait to start learning.” I yawn
for the second time, and then immediately a third.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“The
day after.” She laughs, an angelic sound. “Figure out how best to use your time
till then. Come, child.” And I follow, skipping all the way as an attempt to push
down my mental exhaustion, but I know I am no doubt failing. A nap definitely
awaits.</span></p>
