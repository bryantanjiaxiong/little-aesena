<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
breathe in and out. The green and the blue and the grey and the brown and the
yellow and the orange whirling into a single centre…and done! Back in the
knowledge-filled wonderland!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’re
a natural!” Miss Breezy remarks, her voice sounding significantly bouncier with
the slight echo here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look at my palms. “Was that Spatial Magic? Spatial Ability?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>"No,
child, that’s not a thing. You have too many fictional tales in your head."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
I giggle. “But why not? It’s such a cool name for it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Well,
there’s already an actual term. It’s partially Conjuration Magic, and also
Illusion. A mix of both. And it is <b><i>Magic</i></b>, not an Ability, and we
will discuss the differences between the two later.” I feel her presence
speeding over to the desk, the floating lights glowing brighter as if they are
sensors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy continues: “For now, we will go through the list of what you need to
learn-”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
could not keep it in: “The library and the forest are conjurations, and hiding
them is the illusion of the log-and-rock? But I <b><i>sat</i></b> on the rock.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
does not miss a beat, having probably expected the question. “Illusions can be
physical too. Understand them as distractions. They lure your mind away from
the main purpose, therefore no one would think to dispel it there.
Though…actually…the log-and-rock <b><i>is</i></b> a little obvious. I mean-”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“So
a little girl can be curious enough to examine it.” I giggle again. “But it’s
also like going to another dimension, isn’t it? Didn’t you say this is a
different plane of reality?” I hop around, playing with the swirls and whirls
that are so dancing on the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Ah,
I did. Sorry, phrase misused. But I see where you’re coming from. Still, no one
would understand if you used ‘Spatial Magic’ to describe anything. Come over,”
her voice beckons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
walk in quick strides. “Oh, that means I’ll meet other Magicians, right?
Magicians…Abilitiers?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Both.
And…<b><i>Mages</i></b>, not Magicians.<b><i> </i></b>You will need to learn to
call things by the right names so people can understand you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod thoughtfully. “Yet every period of time calls things differently, I
thought.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Bright
mind, Aesena Varinas,” she agrees, “Yes, there’s that too. You have your work
cut out for you. Maybe in the future, Spatial Magic might properly be a thing.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
will be the one to generalise it!” I lean over the desk. “Anyway, where should
I start?” There are papers stacked in very intimidating heaps, and impressively
rolled-up parchments and scrolls. And of course, the journal. At a side, drawings
of plants and one of a bottle capture my attention, the latter with skilfully
drawn bubbles and swirling liquid inside it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then
they move. Unprepared, I jump backwards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“What
is it?” Miss Breezy notes my sudden movement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That’s
so cool!” I gather up the drawings, looking at them in turn. Whenever I adjust
the angle of looking at one of them, it itself adjusts to my eyes accordingly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
hums. “That will be one of your first lessons. Documenting, reviewing,
organizing, skills that make your duties more convenient so you can better
focus on the mission itself.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look up towards her voice. “What does that mean?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
will learn Magic that can record information for you almost instantly, Magic
that can bring to you a specific object like a book from those shelves, Magic
that can let you read or take in written information faster, Magic that
automatically translates what you say to another language, and so on. Stuff
like that. Little things that you might have wished for along the tediousness
of life.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
marvel at the drawings. “I’ll be able to do <b><i>this</i></b> by next week?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy laughs. “Maybe earlier. If you want to learn advanced knowledge or
skills, you must first be convenient. Ergo.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
squint. Hold on, what does ‘ergo’ mean again...? ‘That’s why’, I think. I know
I have seen that word before. Whatever. Why am I even thinking about that? This
is awesome!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Let’s
begin! Let’s begin!” I am almost hopping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Rein
in your rushes, youngling.” She has an amused tone. “I know it’s exciting, but
for today we’ll mainly discuss on the overall list of things you need to learn,
which is the - quote and unquote - ‘syllabus’.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Aw.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It
won’t be boring, I assure you,&quot; she adds upon noticing my expression, “Trust
me when I say that there are more things to jump up and down for.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
strand of hair falls onto my face, and I blow it back up. “Okay then. What
other Magic must I learn before the jump?” I put down the drawings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy hums again. “I’d say defensive ones, but I think Sharp and Screen can
cover for that. You know, just in case, you need to have combat skills. You’ll
have to utilise your inherited Abilities despite your age,” she pauses for a
long moment, and when I am about to ask her about it, she notes: “You have no
prior experience, I assume.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
shake my head. “None. I’d need a license if I want to practice Sharp Magic. And
my guardians proba-”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Let
me stop you there. <b><i>Abilities</i></b>, not Magic,” she places a heavy
emphasis on the word. “Time to have that discussion I talked about.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“They’re
not the same?” I had always thought they are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Magic,
as you know, is the direct opposite of Logic. Magic makes zero sense.” She
waits for me to nod before continuing: “Abilities, on the other hand, can be
passed down from parent to offspring, and is therefore dependent on racial
biology, which is science, which is Logic, because it makes sense. Understand?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
lean my head back, wrapping it around what I just heard, then I heave it back
forward in a strong nod.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That’s
the shortest explanation I can give you. But, a little trivia: the word
‘Ability’ is derived on one branch from the Latin word ‘habilis’, which means
‘able’, and another branch from the Yehoans, who called the people of Wholeone
‘Abeliyati’, which roughly translates to ‘blessed’.” Wow, Miss Breezy is very
knowledgeable on a lot of things all at once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Abe-Abeli…How
do you spell that?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“A-B-E-L-I-A-T-I,
by the Anglish alphabet.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah,
‘Abeliati’. Close enough. ‘Blessed’, huh? The Yehoans were Men from the
continent of Ictalcy that must have found their Men-counterparts in Wholeone
extremely bizarre, with Abilities that the Yehoans themselves were not
‘blessed’ with. Yet, that did not stop Yehova from conquering half the
continent within two centuries of their arrival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
actually love Yehoan history. There is much glory and philosophy within its
occasional dramatic gruesomeness. With how dominant Yehova was throughout The
First Era, there should surely be a few jumps there. A billion people
throughout time must have dreamt about visiting the ancient empire, and here I
am, a little child entrusted with time-travelling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
put my hands up, digesting the information. “Alright. So not Sharp Magic, but
Sharp Abilities. Same with Screen. And the others? ‘Fire Magic’ obviously
sounds much cooler than ‘Fire Abilities’.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
believe modern media likes painting the terms in ancient languages. For
example…in Graecis, like ‘Pyroabilities’. Is that cool enough for you?” She
shifts into a lighter tone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
burst out laughing. Even I must admit that those ‘spiced-up’ terms are a little
awkward. Yet Graecis-Latin and Leomasaen-Latin are often the victims of such
ridiculousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Recomposing
myself, I continue the topic at hand. “So I can never manipulate Fire or Water,
or anything at all other than my inherited Abilities, right?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That’s
not entirely true. While you can’t utilise Fire as flexibly as Fire Abilitiers,
you can still use Nature Magic, or - quote and unquote – ‘Elemental Magic’,” she
suggests with a huff, “Whatever term your generation likes to use.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
return into my fits of laughter. Miss Breezy’s satirical tone is unbearable!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
joins in with her chuckles as well. “I mean, you can refer to anything anyhowever
you wish, but you need to make sure the listener understands what you’re
saying. Absolutely no one in the fifth century will know what is ‘Elemental
Magic’, or ‘Pyroabilities’ or ‘Aquabilities’, the last one which is actually
quite confused as to whether or not it needs another ‘A’ in the middle.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
pause to contemplate her last line, then upon comprehension, continue giggling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“If
I ever need to make an article to attack modern pop-culture, I’ll come to you
for inspiration,” I quip after I finish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Moving
on: how goes your understanding on the time-travelling algorithm?” And she
returns to solemnness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
thought long and hard about it, but I think I’m still missing a few gears. I
mean, I don’t exactly know what I don’t understand, but I know there’s something.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
‘breezes’ over to the other end of the desk. “That’s a broad area to cover,”
she says.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
cannot help but smile at her witty remark. “I conclude that I just need to jump
to find out. Actions do <b><i>explain</i></b> louder than words.” I feel proud
of coming up with that slight word change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
guess so. But you need to prepare not only by the means of knowledge, there are
also the matters concerning equipment and clothing and routine. You <b><i>are</i></b>
aware that your jump won’t only last a day, right?” Miss Breezy asks
cautiously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“A
week, the journal says.” I sigh, “That’s longer-than-reasonable for a
first-time time-traveller. But how much time would have passed in the…original
ti-no….present?” I think up another structure for the question. “What will
happen here after my jump?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
muses on the question, and after a short while replies: “That’s random, I’m
afraid. But for this first one, I’m sure you’ll not take longer than five
minutes from my perspective.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
widen my eyes. “From your-oh yeah…You’re not coming with me.” I push down the
terror that comes with that reminder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
cannot. Believe me, I would feel more assured if I could. This fixed timeline
of yours that starts you off on such an adventure at such a young age, it makes
me feel guilty that there is simply no way around it.” A slightly downcast tone
washes over her voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“We
both know that I’ll be fine at the end of it.” I point out reassuringly, and at
the same time reassuring myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Yet
what will come before the end, though? I don’t mean to discourage you further,
but my duty is to ensure that you’re ready.” She sounds as if she is bracing
herself. “It’s fifteen centuries into the past, when there are no phones or
electric or the bathrooms that you’re used to. You can conjure a mattress, yes,
but…,” she lets out a sharp breath, “sleep might still come difficult. Food
might not always be conveniently available, though the journal hints that you
will be travelling with other people in a large group, which also presents
another obstacle: socializing, and you need to be very swift on that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“As
the journal also stated, you will be navigating mountains, and you might even
need to get on a ship if you’re going all the way to Isehr, across…war-torn
seas. Even as a thought it is daunting. At best, it will just be exhausting. I
worry if it might be more than that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
distance between Askenny and Isehr by any route is lengthy and harrowing, and
by no means could it be covered in two weeks or even three - or even four,
actually - so why does the journal say that it will only take one? And
everything that Miss Breezy has pointed out…I-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’ve
been quiet for a while, are you okay?” Miss Breezy’s concerned tone worries me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
jump out of my thoughts, then look upwards to the ceiling where the bulbs of
light hover and swim by and along the carvings. “I’ve actually pondered on all
that you’ve said. Trying to sleep under excitement leads to endless waves of
thoughts,” I recall rolling around my bed last night. </span></p>

take in a big breath. “With the help of the Magic I’ll soon learn, I think the
biggest obstacle will just be the culture shock. And…period shock, I guess. Honestly.
I mean, I went camping a few times before, not alone of course…and definitely not
for longer than two nights. But still…without a running shower. But surely the
migrants will be moving close to water sources, won’t they?” Another thought
flashes past my mind. If there are hostile pursuers, however, the migrants
would keep a distance from water, since the hunters would definitely think to
hunt there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Will’…‘Would’…even
though they already happened long ago. Yet they are still ‘will’s and ‘would’s
to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“As
long as I keep going, I’ll be very fine. I’m a little scared, definitely, but I
must also admit I’m even more excited than I was yesterday, and I’ll be even
more so tomorrow.” I show a thumbs up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Hang
tight to that personality of yours, Aesena Varinas, it will doubtlessly ward
off all that is unpleasant,” Miss Breezy says.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
smile. “What else-wait, um,” before I forget the question again, “do you have
any idea as to why this will only take a week? I mean, Isehr from Askenny is
pretty far.” They are almost a landmass apart, actually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I’m
certain it’s your primary objective to figure out, something only you can do,
something that the people that will be travelling with you dearly need.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Hm,
I thought so. “Like activating a portal? Or perhaps a rainbow bridge?” I give
the second notion a slight comical tone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Well,
youngling, don’t phrase it as if rainbow bridges are impossible.” Then she
chuckles at my reaction. “Just keep an eye out. Something will catch it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod, shooting a breath. “What else must I prepare? You mentioned clothing…I
will learn to do Conjurations, right?” I imagine myself doing dress
transformations like Lulala And The Maidens Of The Height. I love that show;
there are different transformation scenes for every episode.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
catches on. “I’d advise you to sew them yourself. With Magic, yes, but not via
conjurations. Better not risk it being unstable. We will get to those things
eventually. You will need to look up the garbs of that period, and the general
material they use for clothes. Or…you can just wrap yourself in a big cloak and
hide everything underneath.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“The
last one sounds cooler.” I let out a short giggle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Then
this particular matter is easily settled.” She laughs with me. “I think it will
be best to also pick up more elaborate survival skills as soon as possible.
Recognizing plants and herbs, cooking quick dishes, hunting…Well, we can do
without the last one for now. Starcharting will prove useful in navigation.
Since you have the time, you should get all these set up.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Starcharting’,
I have never heard the word before, but it sounds so elegant. “I’m good with
the suns and moons throughout the year, but my knowledge on the stars could use
some work,” I admit, “Miss Alice has astronomy lessons planned for me, and
Mister Martin could probably tell me a lot of things about plants. I know a
little cooking myself, though it might be a harder without gas.” I think back
on all that have been discussed. “This is a really intense syllabus, although
of course it’ll be fun to learn so many different things.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Beats
having stagnant days, doesn’t it?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“‘The
future holds uncharted fun,’ a quote by…I don’t actually remember who said that,”
I ponder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Oh
yes,” Miss Breezy suddenly announces, “I was thinking about one small thing I
forgot to say for some time now. It kept slipping my mind. You actually have
homework besides going on the missions.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah…Ah?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Now,
now, it’s nothing like what you’re used to,” she addresses the look I probably
have on my face, “All these books, every paper and every scroll, as you know,
are not simply conjurations. I mean, they didn’t pop out of nowhere. And there
is one tiny detail that will only surface to attention if you think hard about
it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Detail?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Why
do you think the books look new? Did the person who put them there not use them
as well? Maybe it is Magic that cleaned them of age, yes, but there is one
other explanation that will make more sense with the time-travelling algorithm,
if you can connect the dots,” she urges.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
can feel my eyes sparkling at my immediate realisation. “They are new because
they <b><i>are</i></b> new,” I say as I look around, “They’re all replicated,
and brought over from the future via…re-conjuration? Spatial Magic…whatever.” I
await what Miss Breezy is about to say with absolute dread.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Ah,
you caught on so quickly. By hand or by Magic, everything must be copied. In a
way, that will help you revise as well.” She does not sound very sympathetic at
all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Impossible.”
I spin around and around, staring at the shelves that loom so mightily.
Hundreds of them! “All these?” The very notion is out of this world!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It
will be a long time before that specific jump, however, at least a decade, maybe
two, and the Magic that you will learn throughout that time will allow you to
do such mundane chores in a quick snap. So don’t worry,” Miss Breezy consoles,
“Still, I’ll recommend a few more notable titles that you should copy by hand.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>By
hand! I squint in disbelief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Come
to the right side. It’s time for you to see the wings of your desk.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Wow,
what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Though
utterly confused, especially after that explanation on my ‘homework’, I heed
her. “I don’t understand.” The things I do not understand keeps piling up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Imagine
the desk extending, and prepare yourself for a surprise,” she says, deciding to
show rather than explain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So
I do, and I do not even need to hold my hand out. The moment I picture the
table lengthening, it just does so. Small shelves pop out continuously like blooming
flowers in a music video, some with drawers that lurch open before closing as
if they are trying to spit out the abundant knowledge kept inside them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
am frozen, though I should not have been able to feel shocked anymore,
considering this whole world of fantasy that I was thrown into.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Amazing,”
I mouth the words, wondering if I actually said them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“The
left side of the desk extends to an alchemy section, with potion ingredients
and laboratory apparatus. We don’t need those for now. Maybe next week,” she
suggests, “But, um, I think it’s the red one at the front. See it? ‘The Logic
Of Magic’, the red book with the purple lining.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod, reaching my hand to it, contemplating the two words. “But that’s literally
contradictory to that explanation you gave just now. Or is the title just a
clever wordplay?” The book probably lists the aspects of Magic that makes the
most sense, such as Magical Science.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Even
nonsensical events have a sort of system around it, and forces of the world
that seemingly make no sense must at least make a little, else how could anyone
identify or describe it, right?” Miss Breezy pauses for me to nod again before
continuing: “So, for our first month, this will be the subject you’ll be
studying, alongside our other lessons. In time, you will rewrite the whole book
word for word.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
blink rapidly, and she laughs, and I join in. I stare at the book in my hand,
pushing a long breath out of my lungs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Well, let’s get started.”</span></p>
