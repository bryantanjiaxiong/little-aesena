<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
honeyhangs are almost at full-bloom! Mister Martin told me once that a teaspoon
of powder made from the petals can make any drink taste heavenly sweet. Oh, if
only I could have them now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Alright!
I turn away from the window and count the cups I have already prepared. Miss
Alice likes hers as dense as appropriate; Miss Violet prefers hers to have more
moonlaces than redseeds; Mister Martin wants it hot on every day of the week
but Tasday, which is not today; and Miss Emilia always likes it cold, with
icefoam filling up to the brim of the mug. Four cups down, one more to go: a
very specially-made one for Grandmama.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
have thought long and hard last night about this last cup. Grandmama has always
had the members of the household take turns giving her their ‘brew of the day’,
so I am not certain of her preferences. But I will put all my heart into it! The
heart should be sweeter than honeyhangs, I hope! Though…it cannot be <b><i>too</i></b>
sweet, of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Humming
along to the familiar melody that the piano is singing, I take a cup from the
rack, the dark red one that Grandmama always uses, the red as deep as the red
of the bricks that make this house. I turn on the water dispenser, adjusting it
to as hot as hot can be, for it is said that hot drinks are good for everyone,
and I fill half the cup. Then into it I add: a finger-long moonlace, seven
redseeds, five spoonsful of blackapple syrup, two pinches of crushed
wakingleaves, and finally a whole spoonful of winddust. Stirring the mixture, I
count to a hundred, and then it is done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
whole kitchen is filled with the scent of blackapple, with a slight hint of
moonlace and redseed. I wonder if I should add another spoonful of winddust, or
maybe half a spoonful, just for Grandmama’s cup, to make the tastes of the
ingredients melt more into one another. Putting more of it does not change the
result in any way other than making everything feel smoother, but winddust is
expensive. No, then.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
hope the smell does not reach outside the kitchen. I want this to be a surprise
for everyone, though I also worry if they would prefer to have made the drinks themselves.
I know that Grandmama would accept it in earnest no matter what, but…Well, I
tried my best. Let me hope my best is enough. It is the heart that matters, is
it not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>One
by one, carefully, I put the five cups on a tray, and carefully lift it up to
carefully carry it to the living room, where through a window I see Mister
Martin bending over a flowerbed, probably propping the stems. I will use the
second-floor external staircase to get to him later. Miss Violet is still
playing the piano, a sweet morning tune, and so I decide not to bother her yet.
For now, I head up the main stairway and then down the right corridor to
Grandmama’s room. I open the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Good
morning!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Grandmama
turns and smiles to me through the glass sliding door, putting her book down on
her lap. I make sure not to pull on the door too forcefully as I enter the
balcony, and the rising morning instantly splashes onto my face from the side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Grandmama!
I made this for you.” I look down onto my tray, counting to the third cup from
the left on the second row. “Here. Your daily blackapple tea, Aesena’s brew!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Grandmama’s
golden eyes lit up, like the twinkles of stars, and her whitening black hair a
twinkling night sky. “Oh, you good girl. Thank you, Aesy.” She receives the cup
happily. “What ma-”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Excuse
me, Grandmama, but I’ll come back later. Four more cups to deliver!" I lift the
tray back up and hurry – though in a careful not-so-hurried fashion – down the
steps at the side of the balcony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>As
I walk to Mister Martin, who is now tending the waterstalks, rows of sunflowers face
up and bloom in the direction of the sun, the sunrays waking them up from their
slumber, and never before have I felt so lucky for the coincidence. It is like
they are telling me that the day will be different. And how will it not? I am
so off to such a good start.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He
is wearing a dark blue flatcap so as to give his eyes a shade from the
sunlight, to let him focus on his work more conveniently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Good
morning, Mister Martin. I made blackapple tea for you. It’s still hot.” I lift
up the lid to let the steam prove my point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He
turns away from the stalks, cautiously making sure his release does not leave
them swinging. “Why thank you, young madam Aesena. A very good morning to you
too.” He accepts it! He lifts the cup from the tray and takes a sniff and then
a sip, his smile widening. “Thank you. This is good, just the way I like it.
The wakingleaves are just right. But how did you know?” He looks a little
surprised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
told me once a few days ago. I remember. I have to go give Miss Violet her cup
now. I hope you enjoy it!” I wave as I backstep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This
is turning out really well. Ah! Miss Alice is dusting the bell, preparing the
ring of the morning. The bell’s usual shining red is painted over by the deep
orange that is so unfurling, though it is turning into a brighter yellow now
that the sun is rising higher. I change my course towards the tower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Miss
Alice!” I call, and she leans out to look down with her hand holding onto a
pillar. “I made tea! Your morning tea!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
hear an unclear ‘Hold on!’ a brief second before the bell rings, and then in
another minute I hear footsteps coming downwards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Young
Aesena, what have you there?” She comes out into the clearing, her dark blonde hair
bouncing, her white dress flowing in the wind of her hurry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Blackapple.”
I show her, handing over her cup. “Yours has eight spoonsful of the syrup, with
nine redseeds. Did I get it right?” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Alice gasps. “You’re wonderful! Thank you. What brought this up?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
tilt my head in contemplation of her question, then I understand. “Just…wanted
to.” I give her a sheepish smile before looking down at my tray. “I still
have…Do you know where Miss Emilia is? Or Miss Violet?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Alice takes a gulp of her tea then points to the aviary tower. “Miss Emilia was
heading there when I passed her just now.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Thank
you.” I adjust my grip on the tray and stride off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
red-stained glass that makes the dome of the aviary has not yet ceased to
impress me. The entrance is a tower similar to the others, however, though
brick and glass somewhat fit aesthetically. I knock twice on the door, clearly,
before going in and through the small archway. The chirps of birds louden,
those of the brightwings more distinctive to my ears. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Branches
and perches and hang-it-downs fill the dome to fullness, and the rays of
sunlight are brighter than they are outside. Here and there are bushes of
redseeds and dandelnuts grown by the plentiful. “Are you in here, Miss Emilia?”
I keep my voice soft as to not startle the birds. A triplet of doves sweeps
over my head, and I bend by instinct. “Miss Emilia?” I try to spot that
gleaming pair of green eyes that even all the green in this place cannot hide,
then I see her at the section of the white branches. “Miss Emilia, good
morning. I made tea.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Emilia lifts her head up. “Oh, good morning, young miss. Pardon me, but come
again?” She strokes the wings of an owlet as she comes, the bird sleepily
perched on her wrist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
put the tray on a log and picks up Miss Emilia’s cup. “I made your morning tea.
Cold as you prefer it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Ah,
so you did. I was just wanting to go to the kitchens. Thank you very much.” She
takes a long sip, holding the cup with one hand, and not by the handle. “And I
observed that you used ‘Good morning’ rather than ‘Well dawn’, but you need not
make this particular adjustment, you know?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
pick the tray back up. “Just going for something different.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’re
a bright lady.” She looks down. “Who is this last cup for? Your grandmother?
She told me you wish to start your classes in two days.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah.
I nod. “Yes, that’s right. I’m looking forward to Anglish Literature and World History.
You’ll be covering them, right, Miss Emilia? Can we do History first?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
laughs. “Of course. It gladdens me to do so.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Oh,
this is for Miss Violet,” I answer, returning to her question. “Everyone else
already has theirs. So to the piano I go.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Emilia ponders. “I think she said she’s going into town. She told me so
yesterday.” She then puts a finger to her lips, listening intently. “Her
playing has stopped, which means she’s probably about to make her own cup of
tea by now. You must go immediately if you want to catch her.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Oh
no! Then I must leave. Thank you, Miss Emilia!” I turn around quickly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Thank
you again, young miss, this is a very pleasant surprise.” I hear her say, and I
send a speedy wave to the back before going out the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
wonder if Miss Violet can take two cups of tea, but I best make it in time. The
redness of the dome got my vision whirling now that my eyes are adjusting back
to the outside light. I push open the sidedoor into the house with my elbow and
brisk up my pace to the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
it is empty, and in a fumbled confusion I turn around and almost crashed into
Miss Violet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Miss
Violet! Sorry!” I get out of her way at once, but then she clasps both my
shoulders with her hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Steady,
my lady.” And I compose myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
quickly turn around to place the tray on the table and grab the handle of the
last cup on it, extending it to Miss Violet. “I made this for you.” I made it
in time! I lift the lid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
aroma of blackapples still lingers in the kitchen. Miss Violet takes in a deep
breath with the brim of the cup under her nose, her one hand on the handle and
the other supporting the side with the tips of her fingers. I wonder if it is
still as hot as I made it to be. I wait, and then she drinks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Thank
you, my lady. You’re too sweet.” Her bright blue eyes ripple, her golden hair
complementing them, and I cannot help being mesmerized, but after a while I
manage to look away shyly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I

Alice prepare a picnic basket for you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
stop swinging again. “But I have gone for a picnic twice already. There’s
nothing much to see after the first time,” I pause, “But I would if you come
too.” I fill my eyes with as much hope as I can.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Grandmama
laughs. “My legs do not fancy adventure, Aesy. Listen.” She shifts on her
chair, leaning over to me. “The first time and the times after are never the
same, as long as you know how they can vary. There’s always something new for
you to stumble upon, if you just make yourself ready for it, with an open eye.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That
<b><i>is</i></b> what I want. I cannot waste such a good start of the day. It
must continue to be as filled with activities as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
stand up. “Okay. I’ll ask Miss Alice. Can I ask her to come too, if she isn’t
busy?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“She
most probably is, but you can try. You might be lucky,” Grandmama smiles, “Have
a great day. Look for something different. But don’t go too far.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod. “Yes, Grandmama. I’ll tell you all about it later. Have a great day too!”
And off I go, wondering if indeed there would be anything to tell about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Alice must probably be at her office now. I think her chore hours are thirty to
thirty-six in the afternoon, which makes it more likely for me to successfully
get her to accompany me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
frontyard of the observatory tower is specifically for petalballs and ladyhats,
Mister Martin said, where elsewhere is more of a mix of flower species. There
is another similar section at the near back of the compound used for gemlilies,
the main source of income for the manor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
bend down to regard one of the shrubs. I still think that the person who gave the
name ‘ladyhat’ was making a joke. The flowers do not look like hats at all,
much less something a lady would wear. I straighten back up and head to the
stairs lining the external walls of the tower, the red railing casting long
tendril-like shadows on the red bricks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
door is unlocked. I was right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Excuse
me, Miss Alice? It’s me again,” I announce.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Alice looks up from the sheets of paper in front of her. “Young Aesena? Do you
have another cup for me?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
question surprises me. “Hm? I can go-”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
giggles. “I was kidding. Come in.” Miss Alice is ever in a cheery mood. Her
desks are filled with stacked-high books and documents, with only one of them
having a writing space that even so is hardly big enough. The other members of
the household have many books too in their respective rooms, also as stacked as
Miss Alice’s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Two
fifths of the glass dome roof are slid open while the others are covered by
metal panels. Miss Alice once showed me the starry sky when she opened all five
of the panels. That was…the second night after I reached, I think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Your
blackapple tea was as wonderful as you, young Aesena. Thank you again.” Miss
Alice rolls up the papers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Joy
fills my heart once more. “I’m very happy to hear that.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
turns to me, the rolls of paper in both her hands. “Is there anything you need
of me?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Grandmama
told me to go out on a picnic again. Can you help me?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Yes,
immediately. Let’s go.” She puts down the papers before walking to me at the
door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Can
you come with me too?” I ask, a little meekly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Alice stops in her steps. “You’re very lovely, young Aesena, but I must take a
rain check on that. I need to rush on a project.” Her expression turns
apologetic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Oh.
That’s okay.” I try my best to hide my disappointment, but I really do not know
how. “What are you working on?” I move the conversation elsewhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It’s
almost mid-Oscy, and this year the Butterfly Comet is coming again.” Miss Alice
must have picked up the hint on my attempt. “Do you know of the Butterfly
Comet?” She walks me out, closing the door to the observatory and letting me go
down the stairs first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod. I remember the children’s story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“They
also say that the left wing of the Butterfly Constellation might be seen at
this part of the world,” she continues, “I wish to chart the factors of how
that can happen. We might even see the comet pass in front of the wing, even
though we’re nowhere near Choushi. The wing might overlap with the Dancing
Crab, however, and the Winged Arrow is acting really weird this year.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
lost me at ‘Choushi’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
didn’t get that last part, did you?” Miss Alice notices, giggling. “I can’t
wait to teach you about the skies. You’re in for a huge treat, young Aesena.”
She spins once and hops over a shrub of petalballs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
<b><i>am</i></b> excited to learn more in-depth about the suns and the moons
and the stars, though I think it will be overwhelming for my brain. And I am
honestly more interested in the other subject that Miss Alice will be covering:
Magical Science.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We
reach the kitchen. Miss Alice gets to work by making toasts before starting up one
of the stoves for a quick cheese omelette. Then in the oven she heats up clouds
and bacon and sausages before frying them. I find it hard to keep up with her
swift and naturally precise movements such that my ‘assistance’ might just be
getting in her way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Before
long, everything is readied and packed in a basket, with the utensils and
plates plus a blanket and an umbrella.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
really feel bad about not joining you. Can you ask me again next time?” Miss
Alice hands the basket to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod fervently. “Definitely, Miss Alice, I understand. Thank you so much for
your help.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Off
you go now. The morning is still young, with plenty of sunshine to bathe in,
plenty of wind to dance with, plenty of colours to sing of, plenty of chances
to embrace, and plenty of others and plenty of more. Make the best of it.” She
ushers me out the frontdoor, and waves to me as I turn to go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I skip to the gates before turning back
one more time to give Miss Alice a big wave. Then I continue skipping, the
basket swinging lightly.</span></p>
