<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>On
a drive from the small village of Maalos to the Le-Var Coastway, one would
likely miss a windy lane branching off to curve around a hill. Though at first
seeming a little shady, with the shadows of large leaves and overgrown bushes
casting such a sinister appearance at the junction, when given an adventurous
chance, it opens up to lush greeneries that reach out from tall lean trees,
where under them are only well-mannered grass, flower bushes, and the
occasional passing of a deer or a hedgehog. Going on further, it will again
branch off to the city of Onleft and the Wholeone Highway Route Four that
connected Soria with the rest of the continent, but neither is where this
story is bringing us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
lane gives a lengthy journey as it curves widely around groves and lakes. Far
from its meeting with the highway while also far from its branching from the
village road, it bends the widest around an enormous tree that has stood for a
thousand years. Around the tree are smaller ones, all of which seem to be
leaning towards it, and those that meet its trunk creep upwards, almost like
they are merging into the width of the old entity. The locals call it ‘The Tree
Of Trees’, or 'The Growmany Tree'. After this large curve, the lane then
strikes across a river with the help of an ancient stone bridge. But we are not
going there either. At least, not yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Directly
opposite the big old tree and without a path leading to it, hidden from the
lane by hedges and misbehaving ferns of a huge variety and at the same time
flanked at the rear by shallow forests that deepens into the mysterious
Hawkwoods, it is little wonder how The Round O’ Way Manor is rarely disturbed
by passersby. On discovery, however, one would first smell the aroma of the
daily bakes before being splashed by a burst of scents from flowers and herbs
and honeyhangs and being further mesmerised by the melody of a morning piano, then
one would marvel at the maroon stones that stack up here and there to become
sheds and towers and mansion, altogether forming this great manor. Its three
chimneys smoke no matter the time of day, and once each break of dawn and
another each fall of dusk, the bell in one of its four towers rings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
narration is about to end, for here comes our young protagonist. Through one of
the many windows, a girl is seen stirring up a drink in a blue mug, adding
ingredients by a pinch or a spoonful as she goes. It takes two full minutes for
her to be satisfied with her work, then she places the cup with three others.
She looks out the window to gleam at how the sunrays sheen the honeyhangs, and
how the dewdrops are lit with the morning as they dangle from the leaves. Her shoulder-length
black hair catches the sun as well, and her amber-gold eyes sparkle with a
sudden wonder, as if she is aware of what the day will soon bring. She is not,
of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It has been two weeks since her parents
dropped her off in the middle of these greens and blues, with their work in the
city so acalling. That meant sixteen whole days of nothing too exciting as she
navigated through the adjustment of calling the place her new home, which can very
possibly drive anyone mad. So the little Aesena Varinas took to herself the
necessity of waking up early this very day to start making herself useful as an
effort to spend her long pent-up energy, and to probably feel productive – and
exhausted should this activity lead to another and then another – the next time
she goes to bed. She has quite the positivity that many of us crave in our stories,
but this is hers, and so it begins.</span></p>
