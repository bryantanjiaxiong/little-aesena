<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
leaves above sing along with the wind, and for the third time, one lands onto
my head with a light pat. I giggle as I swipe it off, almost pulling out a lock
from my twintails. I rearrange my hair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
like this spot. The ground is a little steep, but that means it is easier to
straighten my legs. The small road below is often empty, sometimes for as long
as I observe it, and when a car does pass I can look at it trail along the road
like a toy-car set and attempt to block it from my vision with a thumb to see
if I could predict its speed as I follow its route.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
I also like to imagine that this specific tree enjoys my company. It probably
has not had a child have a picnic under it before me. I wonder how the whole
area would look like up on its highest point. To the left is Grandmama’s manor,
to the front the road and the Growmany, to the right…a lot of densely packed
trees, and to the back…even more trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
would be marvellous to behold them in a complete panoramic spot. Maybe someday
I will climb up, when someone else is around. Miss Alice is a great climber,
she told me. I saw her repair the roofs before, going up and down without a
ladder, scaling the storeys with ledges and window frames and jutted ornaments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Perhaps
the days here will be filled with interest once the lessons start. That is why
I am so eager for them. And perhaps I should have brought a book with me before
coming out, maybe one on History or…Actually, a novel would do. There is food
enough for three servings, since I noticed a dozen slices of buttercake under
the packaging of the toasts. Miss Alice must have put them in there when I was
not paying attention. I will be here for some time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Well,
the scenery entertains, at least. I turn to where the basket is for another
slice of bacon. I am curious as to how it might taste between two toasted bread
with the cheese omelette. And after trying this combination, I will add a
sausage in the next one, making it a roll. Oh, I almost forgot the clouds. They
<b><i>must </i></b>join in the fun as well, these fluffy chewy lovelies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
blue flash catches my attention, and I face it. But there is nothing. I swear I
saw-Ah, there it is! What is it? And it disappears again. Is it twinkling?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Deep
within the woods behind the tree I took as my favourite, a single blue light
beams and vanishes. In four-second intervals, I count. It is not really bright,
for it does not cast the trees in blue glare on its way to my eyes, but it is
very distracting: A bead of blue, sparkling alone among the shadows of the oh-so-tall
trees, where under the trees is just flat grass, not even a bush of fern or flowers
in sight. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
is a dark green floor with hundreds of tall brown pillars supporting a roof of
translucent lime green, having a bit of yellow spilling here and there but
otherwise is dim and gloomy. And the blue light lies ahead, far within, but it
continues to flash as if it is so near, giving me the urge to just reach out
and close my hands around it, as if the woods make the pit of a schoolbag, and
I am fumbling in search of…the blue light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
block it with my thumb, to see if my thumb could be outlined in blue when the
light flashes. And it is. I laugh then, and turn away, deciding not to give it
too much thought, though my mind easily wanders back to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What
could it be? A fallen star? Ridiculous. How was that the first thought that
came…Oh, a torchlight? Though who could have ventured into these woods without stumbling
on the manor, which one could have clearly seen even from where the blue light
is? Hm, could the manor be seen?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In
the corner of my eye, I can still see it flashing. Or I am just imagining it,
then the blue light is <b><i>truly</i></b> calling out to me. I turn to it
again with a somewhat excited sigh of hesitation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Look
for something different in every day,’ Grandmama’s words echo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
there is no one here to take care of me. And I did not bring my phone out,
though it would not do me any good in a forest even if I did. If I remember
correctly, these woods would eventually lead to Hawkwoods, a place that
inspired many a horror story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
many storybooks and children’s tales I have read have one constant reminder,
that things like approaching a blue light shining deep inside a shadowy forest
can only mean trouble: a trap laid by goblins or kidnappers, a portal to
another realm, a collective glare of a dragon’s treasure trove that…suddenly
accumulated, a cursed artifact dropped accidentally by an evil sorcerer, a
fallen star that might explode any second now…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There
is no stopping my curiosity and impatience, however. I pack up my stuff just in
case I might get lost, so at least I have something to eat for a while. I
cannot believe that that is the one solution my mind went to. The blue light
could be something extremely dangerous for all I know. Anything near Hawkwoods
is potentially filled with unpredictable Magic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
it could also be something I can only look for once in my life, and I will
definitely not miss it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
day has been going well so far, having started with preparing those cups of
tea. Surely it will end nicely, right? I really hope I get to have dinner back
in the manor tonight, yet these worries cannot stop me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘The
legs of the young are meant for adventures,” Grandmama likes to say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Oh
well, here goes nothing. I stand up, smooth my skirt down, and head in the
direction of the woods, and slowly the singing of my tree’s leaves grow faint,
replaced by the eerie roars of the woods. Here the leaves sound fiercer, as if
they are warning me to stay out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Yet
I go on further. To my relief, my ears pick up the chirping of birds. I look up
to realise that the leaves and branches make a lovely canopy, and suddenly the
woods do not feel as scary as before. I feel relaxed again, but the continued
flashing of the blue light reminds me of the still-present danger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look backwards, spotting my tree, deciding that it is time to start memorising
trees as landmarks. Despite their imposing sizes, they are loosely positioned. I
will also be walking straight anyways, so the danger is lessened, though Magic
could easily misdirect me and set me on an aimless wander. If that is so, it
would already be too late now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
make sure to tread softly, just in case there is truly a kidnapper or a goblin
or a troll or an evil sorcerer in wait. I observe: A tree that has three juts
on its trunk at the height of my waist, a tree with its trunk covered with moss
up to the height of my knee, a tree that makes an almost-perfect circle with
its leaves in the canopy above, a tree with a trunk of an obviously lighter shade
of brown, a tree with a lot of fallen twigs around its bottom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
is probably one of the worst tracking tactics that anyone has ever thought of,
but I have faith in my brain storage to keep all this mental images.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Is
the light flashing slower? I pause, tripping a little, almost losing my
attention on the light, which if I had would have jeopardised my entire situation.
I keep my eyes forward, in the direction of the blue light that is no longer
there, and I wait. Sure enough, it appears again, but in a much slower fashion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
it fades. I start counting. Is the battery of the torchlight dying? Is the
portal closing? Is the artifact losing its power? Is the star going to explode
after all? Is the trap sensing-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Eight
seconds!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
breathe in, and I breathe out. And I breathe in again, and I breathe out again.
Should I go further? I am almost there, but should I? Perhaps this is my last
chance to do so, and maybe I would forget all about this if I turn and run back
to the manor. Or I would beat myself up for chickening out, then never knowing
what the blue light could be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
keep walking, but slower now. Very slow, with feathery steps. I notice another
tree that could be a landmark, this time with a huge root pushed out from
beneath the ground. I remember: juts, moss, circle, brown, twigs, root. They
are only to assure myself that I am going the right way on my way back later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Nine-second
intervals now, I pause to count, or near nine seconds. The leaves roar again,
and I can no longer hear the birds. There is not a single insect too, which is
peculiar. I have an urge to look upwards but I know if I do I might have a hard
time looking for the right direction again. Even now I doubt if I am going the
right way when the blue light fades, with every direction looking the same
without it. I should probably only walk when it shines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Look
forward…Look forward…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ten
seconds and then eleven seconds, closer and closer. I deduce that the light
flashes slower the closer I go. Either that or it is dimming and I am running
out of time to get to it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
portal is closing…Where does it go? Why does it-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Fifteen
seconds. I am using too much time stopping to count and too much time stopping
to doubt my direction. I hasten my pace, though still keeping my footsteps
soft. I start to take bigger steps, like when I was tiptoeing to the toilet or
to the kitchen in the middle of the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
flashes again, and when it fades I realise that it is just a few steps away
now, somewhere in front of a large log that is on an almost-flat rock, the
first log on the first rock I have seen since entering these woods. I almost
cannot believe that I have finally reached it. It flashes once more, and I
continue walking towards it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
is clearly not a fallen star or a treasure trove or a portal, though it could
still be a trap or an artifact or a dozen other things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
arrive at a small clearing, where in the centre is the log and the rock and the
light that has faded. I put down my basket with the handle facing backwards to
indicate the direction I came from, an action I almost forgot, with the urge to
look up so compelling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
canopy is broken here, the sunlight pouring in, splashing onto the trees on one
side but not reaching the ground, though here it is not as dim as my walk
through the woods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
wait, and I wait, counting, but the flash does not reappear. A minute passes,
and the log and the rock remains a log and a rock, and nothing else. Another
minute goes and my impatience is pricked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then
an idea strikes. I step backwards, putting some distance between me and the
clearing then putting more. And the blue light flashes again. Then I run at it
before it starts fading, though it still fades, but I manage to keep in mind
its position on the rock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
pant, finding myself looking at a pebble. I blink twice, then I blink thrice
more, then I squeeze my eyes shut for as long a moment as my excitement can
grant me, and when I open my eyes the pebble is still a pebble. And it is not
like those shiny reflective pebbles or white smooth pebbles. It is not even
blue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
is grey and not rounded, a little like a one-corner-longer pyramid when I am
observing it from one angle and from another it is an oval with slight juts. It
also seems meticulously placed, at the centre of the rock’s surface just in
front of the log.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
cannot believe my eyes. What-How-Why-How did a pebble like this shine, and with
such a strange pattern? Why did it stop flashing when I am near to it? Why does
it look so normal? This is rather anti-climactic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Well,
this is a sloppy bait if this is a trap, though since it got me here, one could
say it worked quite well. But it is not a trap. This feels too random.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look around once again. Truly, the woods look the same everywhere. The pillars
that are the tree trunks loom like slender giants, and the leaves paint a green
night sky with billions of stars with a large sun at its centre. There is only
silence hanging in the air, and it seems as if it is waiting. I wonder what it
is waiting for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
start walking the perimeter of the clearing, all the while looking at the
pebble sitting there. Perhaps it would burst into flames or transform into
shiny goo should I pick it up, so I dare not. Maybe the pebble is not normal
after all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>My
mind is swamped with tales and folklore that I have read before as I try to
remember anything that could give me some insight into this situation. But I
got nothing. This is a mystery. Either that or it is a random Magical
Happening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Why
are there no other rocks? This is weird. Why is this pebble the only pebble
here? Where did it spring from? There are no rivers here, and the sea is far
away, and the winds do not feel strong at all so far below the height of the
canopy. Did a bird place it here, perhaps? Well, some winds can carry stones,
with Magic and all that. And this <b><i>is</i></b> near to Hawkwoods. But that
cannot be the only answer to this riddle. Magic is too broad a topic. So Magic
how?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Oh…Oh!
Oh! It is an egg! It could be. It would make sense. Wait…no it would not. What
kind of uncaring mother would lay an egg without supplying it heat or nest? Why
is it not here protecting it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
sigh in disappointment. I cannot think of anything. What a letdown! I have
spent so much time to get here too. The sunlight looks about near midday.
Perhaps I should be relieved that this did not end up being dangerous, but I
cannot help feeling deflated, as if the day had betrayed me. Should I at least
take the pebble back? It is still unexplained why it can flash.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
laughs then, a heavenly sound, and the leaves roar with her. “No, child, I’m
not Him, nor any of Them.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Them’?
What does she mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Who
are you?” I ask instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
can almost imagine a woman in glowing silk robes bending down to observe me
curiously. “You must probably be regarding me as a forest spirit, but I’m not
exactly one. I would give you my name if you give me yours, child.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
hesitate. There is no apparent harm in telling her. “My name is Aesena
Varinas.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
sighs, almost in relief for some reason. “And you can call me Breezy.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Something
tells me that I have just got tricked, though in a trivial way. “I can call you
‘Breezy’? But that’s not your name, is it?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’re
very bright, child. Interesting. I seem to have just admitted that you’re
right, didn’t I?” She laughs again. “You’re not right, however, but ‘Breezy’
will do.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
must go around this carefully. “Okay, ‘Breezy’, what do you mean…‘begin’?” I slowly
word the question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
becomes silent, probably trying to understand my meaning, then she remembers.
“Ah, I meant that I didn’t know how to greet you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
ponder. “‘Greet me’…um…why?” Perhaps it is because I am intruding. “Is this
your domain? Are you tied to this clearing?” I turn back to the log and the
rock, and when she speaks again, I turn to her. Well, not ‘her’ actually, but I
need to imagine I am facing something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Oh,
no, no. You just called me ‘Breezy’ yourself. I can go anywhere. And to answer
your first question: we needed to meet.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That
gives me another guess. “Are you a wind spirit?” I ask quickly after.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
hums, a melodious sound. “Can’t exactly say I am one either. No, I’m not any kind
of spirit.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then
her last line to my question before hits me. ‘We needed to meet’?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
am baffled. “Hold on, what do you mean? Why do we need to meet? And if you can
go anywhere…why did you greet me here? Why not when I was outside the woods?” I
feel like I am interviewing someone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That’s
a lot of questions, child.” She pauses, then she hums again. “Honestly? I
thought that if you really enter the woods to seek out the blue light that you
saw, then I would greet you, otherwise I would leave you be, for maybe it’s not
the right time. It’s like flipping a coin.” I can almost see a grin in the air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Still
confusing, but…“It’s heads then,” I remark playfully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Breezy’
seems to have ‘breezed’ to the opposite side of the clearing, and so I turn as
well, going along with my imagination. “Not quite. We should not discriminate.
It could be tails for the more positive choice. Though, what do you think? Is
this the more positive outcome?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I’m
still finding out.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
she ‘breezes’ around again. “You’re already very intelligent as a youngling.
Too intelligent. And I don’t only mean it as a praise. It is a clear
observation.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
turn and turn, keeping up with my imagination, though is it really my
imagination? Maybe I am sensing her presence…or something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’re
also able to pinpoint my main location,” she continues, “I mean, where I mostly
am. Do you understand? I mean-”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“The
core?” I suggest. Then it is not my imagination after all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Precisely.
Though…” she trails off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Not
exactly,” I finish for her, and she laughs, louder than when she laughed
before. I find myself laughing too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“A
great command of your language too. Very fluent.” Her observing me somehow feels
patronising, like a military officer sizing up a recruit. “And very careful in
every step you take. You <b><i>are</i></b> still ready to run should this go
south, aren’t you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
contemplate my situation. “It would still be too late, but I can get myself
some distance, then luck will continue for me.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Ha!
Grand answer.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
leaves above sings, then quietens. “It won’t turn south, will it?” I want one
last confirmation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“No,
I assure you, it won’t,” ‘Breezy’ confirms, “So sit, please, continue your
picnic under the song of the canopy. We have much to talk about.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look again at the log and the rock. “About the pebble? Did you put it there?” I
gesture to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Not
really about the pebble. And no, it has been there for quite some time, along
with the log and the rock, but that’s a very long story. A very remarkable one
though, but it’s meant for some other time.” Every word she speaks somehow
wakes my senses up, her soothing voice clearing my mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“We
have much to talk about?” I repeat what she said, tilting my head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Don’t
we, Aesena Varinas?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
do still have tons of questions. Why do we need to meet? What is that pebble? Why
does it shine blue when it is not blue? Can we have our conversation outside
the woods? Could she be a pixie flying about with a microphone?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There
is a thrill coursing through my veins, reverberating with my relief to have
come for the blue light. Where is it leading me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I realise that I am smiling. That must be
a good sign that I am comfortable with this. And so I take the remainder of the
fried food out, careful not to move the basket, and sit onto the rock, ready to
listen.</span></p>
