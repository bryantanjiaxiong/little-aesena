that’s why they migrated. Yet even so, The Dedads control The Mouth Of Lasa,
where the strait opens to before reaching the ocean, therefore the migration is
further hindered. Isehr is the most strategic location in that aspect. On that
note, while the island was highly sought after, The Dedads held onto it firmly
against the attacks of their neighbours: the powerful Yuhenici Empire from the
East and The Winterlands from the North.”</span></p>

he was willing to give. The Strait Of Lasa, The Islandcity Isehr, The

Cavals are evil! Why did they have to be so terrible?” I at least know about
The Caval Kingdoms, the horse-riding peoples who raided and pillaged and sacked
across what Soria was, displacing the native tribes and destroying hundred-thousands
of lives, and furthering the damage when they even started fighting each other.
I find myself frowning in disgust, looking at the depictions of them in an
ancient artwork illustrated on a page.</span></p>

how history now remembers them, yes. But the Ripriice were a shunned race,
isolated and discriminated by Mankind, and they still are. As they were hated
so would they have hated,” Miss Emilia reasons, and I recall the quote: ‘Hated,
they hate’. “It’s easier to just draw a line and then call it good or evil, but
if it was that simple, there wouldn’t be conflict, would it? The Ripriice had
to survive, and they decided that this was the best method in achieving
survival. Remember, times were extremely hard then, and different.”</span></p>

trail off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

Ripriice needed to ensure the resources and the strategical geography of the
cities and towns they attacked would not end up in enemy hands or join up with
enemy forces, a situation which would threaten them, so they sacked them all
before razing them to the ground. I at least know those factors, but war is
ever so inhumane!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

didn’t ask yet, young miss, but why the sudden interest in The Second Era?” She
inquires, pulling me out of my thoughts, “I thought you’re more invested in The
First. And why the fifth century too?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
try to answer as quick as I can to seem as natural as possible, though the
attempt might actually backfire. “I’m trying to understand more about The Great
Southern Migration and its participants. I read an article about it yesterday,
and I think it piqued my curiosity.” I put on a steady face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

seem quite immersed in the subject.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
might just blow the secret if I persist in such carelessness. “A sudden
passion, and I want to make the best of it.” This is the first <b><i>and</i></b>
last time I am using my classes to learn about specific periods and regions,
even though there is still like…hundreds of periods to research on. Or I might
just need to be more subtle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ha!
I do not actually need to worry. Given my fixed future, I will not be met with
too heavy a problem anyway, and even if one does find me, it would be settled
in its own time and method. I need only wait! Yet…perhaps that is the one thing
Miss Breezy warned me about, so I must continue to think out my problems myself
regardless of the fact that they will definitely be solved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
do not wish to lead a boring life of waiting for endings. I will experience the

problems that await ahead…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Are
you listening, young miss?” Miss Emilia’s voice jerks me out of my thoughts.
“How did the Alari win The Battle Of Glodun even though the orc-city was
located on a fortified mountainside?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Oh,
um, um…“Um, they climbed up the steeps on the other side with their horses and
archers,” I got this, “and rained fire onto the city from above, harassing the
defenders throughout the siege. When the orcs came out of the walls, they used
their horses for a downhill charge. They started upwards on…” Ah, I am lost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“On
The Foot Of Cadon.” She smiles, finishing for me. “That’s good enough. Colour
me impressed; you learn lightning fast.” She heads to the bookshelves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
beam at that, putting a hand under my cheek. Still, I cannot help but wonder…I
lean forward to look at the passage. Hm, year 472, and not year 477, good. Since
the journal said ‘to cross a mountain’, which I assume concerns one of the
mountains along The Essarian Ridge, I would have been extremely worried if I
had to go through <b><i>that</i></b> battle. The entry did also say ‘not
dangerous at all’ though, so do I not need to worry?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Which
also reminds me: what kind of ‘fun meeting’ could be waiting for me on the
first jump? What does that description mean? I remember it is about going to
the year 331, but without any other sidenotes. Could it be an assembly of
time-travellers? I wonder if the location matters…Do I just jump to where year
331 needs me to be by just ‘jumping’? I will ask Miss Breezy tomorrow; best not
wander directionless in this lane of thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Back
to the subject of year 477, I have been pondering on the possibilities all
night, but the reason I need to travel to Isehr all the way from Askenny has
yet to properly dawn on me. Though…I <b><i>could</i></b> be participating in one
of the migrations, most probably actually, since ‘Many carriages’ is written in
that entry. But still, why is a little girl needed there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A
better question is: why is a little girl needed anywhere?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If
the purpose of my first ‘mission’ actually <b><i>is</i></b> participating in a
migration, the entry could have at least stated the details of that migration
so I could at least look for information on it. But alas…Maybe the purpose is
not a migration? A trade caravan expedition, maybe? An…An army, perhaps? Whatever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Emilia bends over the desk, opening another book in front of me. “Here, this
perfectly illustrates and analyses the spread of The Cavals from Eastern
Wholeone, how they are divided by their own ever-in-conflict leaders,” she
flips and points and flips, “how they affect their neighbours, which eventually
also became their targets of conquests, and how they altogether ultimately met
their fall.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Gold!
I almost voiced that out loud. I love mapbooks! The word ‘Askenny’ immediately
captures my eye, the ancient version of Ashcurn. Though the names are quite
similar themselves, I still double-checked with my phone yesterday night, for
assurance. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
wriggle in my seat to readjust the folds of my dress, then I start flipping
through the book, putting my focus on the region. Askenny changed hands a few
times: from a self-governing Yosetian-city at first, till it became a Yuhenici
settlement, then it was raided by The White Ripriice, but after that it was
rebuilt, yet it was raided once more, this time losing many lives…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
turn to the last few pages, but the city remains uncoloured and unmarked by any
of the faction names, meaning that it had disappeared from the world, probably
destroyed. I did also read that it was only rebuilt two or three hundred years
ago, with the new settlers finding only ash and dust on their arrival, and
maybe that was where the city got the new name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
go back to the front. “Where did the Yosetians move to?” I go on flipping
through the book again, watching as the red colour that indicates their faction
ownership shrinks into a speck on the map before vanishing completely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“They
no longer have a state of their own, having gone northward into The Empire,
integrating into Yuhenici society and mingling with other races, mainly Men,”
Miss Emilia explains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“‘Have’?
Not ‘had’?” I notice. I always thought they were wiped out cleanly, and I have
always felt sad for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
hums. “It’s still a controversial subject. Redskins are no longer seen, but
Fire Abilities live on in their descendants. Some Yosetian traits remain while
others disappear into time. It’s a rather dark history.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Mankind
has always loved boasting, it is almost like a subtle tradition to boast, and I
think they would prefer it to be said that they ‘absorbed’ the Abilities of
other races. There was a children’s story, I remember…‘The Thieves Of Gifts’,
and it described a similar plot which I only understood better after looking
into a more mature version.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
Yosetians’ cultures were stolen by Men, as were others like the Varyaeyi and
the Gusts. Sometimes the history of Mankind makes me feel shameful of being one.
What horror…But…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Fire
Abilities! Fire Magic! I might learn that soon! Yet…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Only
those of Yosetian-descent have access to Fire Abilities, right?” What did Miss
Breezy mean when she said I will practice Magic with her, even though she must
have known I only have Man-blood. I mean, as far as I know. Maybe there is a
kind of Magic to learn the Magic I normally would not be able to. Or maybe she
simply meant Sharp and Screen Magic, the custom Abilities borne by Men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That’s
correct. I have to leave you now, young miss, but feel free to use the room as
long as you like.” Miss Emilia holds the door open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look up from the book. “Are you going to the aviary?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Yes.
Oh, last…week, you wished to tend to the plushes when they hatched, I recall.
Do you still-” She laughs upon noticing the look in my eyes, “Well, we have
five newborn plushes this morning. Come to them after you finish up here. I
will ready them for you in an hour.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Thank
you, Miss Emilia,” I say as she leaves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then
the door reopens. “I’ll let you name one,” she offers excitedly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
open my mouth after registering what she said but the door closes just as
quickly. I take in a long breath instead, filling my lungs with the aroma of
blackapple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Sharp
Magic. Screen Magic. If I assume correctly, Miss Alice will be the one to teach
them to me in the far future. But she would probably not consent to let a
twelve-year old practice Magic, unless I try to explain everything to her.
There is also the necessary application procedure to be a certified Abilitier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>No,
I cannot. Miss Breezy is the only one that can teach me Magic for now. No one
else can know. Though…what harm can it be, if the future is already set and I
am ‘doomed’ to succeed? I guess most important decisions will be based on my
personality, therefore I should be loyal to it and not tell anyone about this
‘secret’ if I truly feel that I should be cautious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah.
Anyever will do. I keep thinking that my actions might change the course of
time before remembering that they cannot, and when I do remember the latter, I
want to try to change the course of time, though, again, I am also aware that I
cannot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
find myself staring at the first page of the mapbook, realizing that I have
probably been doing that for a couple minutes. I flip through the thickness
casually, squeezing my mind in my attempted memorization of as many names as
possible. Then I heave my head back, sighing deeply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
am actually relieved that it will be The Second Era that I am jumping to, and
not The First, which had too many irregularities to consider. Magic all around
the world was ridiculously unstable back then. Sometimes mountains could move
or disappear, and sometimes the sky could come crashing down, and sometimes the
air could compress to squeeze everything like it is wringing out a sponge. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
Magical Happenings themselves <b><i>are</i></b> interesting to read about, but
it must have been harrowing for everyone in that era, when technology and
knowledge were not yet too advanced and the chaos was further intensified by
war and famine. At least, that is the extent of what I learnt from books.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
beginning of The Second Era had The Shifted Heavens Phase, which saw a
permanent halt to many Magical Happenings. There are a few exceptions, no
doubt, as most Magical things usually have. I think there were two or ten
Magical portals that linked places that would otherwise be far apart; Miss
Emilia mentioned it just now when we were going through some unorthodox
troop-travelling methods of the period, but the names of the factions very
easily escaped my memory. And of course, there are still remaining instances of
my favourite Magical Happening: Water Rings, massive and awesome sinkholes in
bodies of water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Concerning
The Shifted Heavens Phase is a most famous story: The Legend Of The Five Heroes
is known by every child and adult of every race. I look to the bookshelves to see
if Miss Emilia has a version of it, but there is not a similar title.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>She
has a huge collection of books, not comparable to the treasure vault that is…<b><i>my</i></b>…study,
but still altogether impressive. The ones on the middle-left shelf are actually
written by her own mind and hand, with titles like ‘An Analysis of The Spread
of Anglish’ and ‘The Current House Of The Usii, Descendants Of Yehova’. I take
a closer look, rolling my chair to it. There is an especially thick volume
titled ‘Thellioni and Lysisa’, the two goddesses of ancient Harmonia, a First
Era faction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

accomplished university where I am the only student.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Staring
at ‘Thellioni and Lysisa’, I hop back into my thoughts. I will still have to
visit The First Era despite all its terrors. There were a few First Era entries
in the journal. It might just be my very next one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>How
did things come to today again? I do not remember. The blue light…I take out
the pebble from my pocket, observing its uneven surfaces. Is this truly not a
dream? Is this all really real?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Like,
<b><i>really</i></b> really?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
would be disappointed if it is not, but I might actually be relieved, knowing
that my life is going to be the same even though I am ever yearning for
something new and different. The first ‘jump’ would lead to a completely new
life as an actual time-traveller. No more twelve-year old girl with a normal
twelve-year old life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
must make sense in the end, that I am the one to do this and not anyone else.
It has to, and I am destined to find out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ah,
yes! I am ‘finding out’. It does not truly matter if I know my ending, but
along the way towards it, it matters that I must find the meaning of it. Why
and how, and then why and how. That is a great thought to have, I think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
kick my legs out to let the chair roll around, its wheels silent, and I spin.
The dark red ceiling above looks familiarly warming even though I only came to
know it two weeks ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
really want to discuss this with someone. Well, someone other than Miss Breezy.
Someone that can be amazed by the wonder of it all. I want to tell Grandmama,
and I want to send a call to Mama and Dada. I wish to see their reactions to
this wonderfully incredulous tale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Hm…The
sunrays shining in get caught in my eye as my spinning nears the window, and I
stop. Miss Emilia’s study overlooks the gemlilies, and if I press my face to
the glass, I could see the windows of Mister Martin’s. I squint, my eyes
catching the outline of a petalfly on the cover of an upright book, stood up on
the wall-shelf. A petalfly…or a rose, whatever the flower is. That must be his
latest Gardening Journal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
push away, continuing my ponderations, but…I will decide after my first jump, I
guess. Maybe I might reveal everything. Maybe I will not. One thing I know for
sure is that this month holds a promising amount of adventures and exploits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And I can’t sit still thinking about it</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>!</span></p>
