<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

Just how many conjurations is the illusion of the log-and-rock hiding?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It
is like a ripple, how the forest speeds away from me in every direction, the
clearing widening, like standing in a sea of green as the water recedes outward
in a circle. Like the legend: The Maads And The Parting Of The Ocean. Like a
Water Ring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>As
the field replaces the forest, the log-and-rock transforms into a row of
weapon-stands. Bows, daggers and swords and even pistols are displayed in
shining splendour, each with detailed carvings and ornaments, totally a scene
from some kind of ancient treasure armoury.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I

assume," I gesture around me, "my training ground." And it is huge! "Are there
any more venues the log-and-rock can lead to?" A waterfall and a lake would be
really nice now that my imagination is running free. Or a meadow with singing
flowers and dancing animals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Those
are real guns,” I point, “Am I going to learn to use all these?” The notion
does scare me a little. Weapons are only pretty on a television screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Well,
um, all in good time,” she repeats, but this time with a hesitant tone, “Most
of these are too heavy for you at the moment. You can manipulate their weight
to suit your perception when you learn the right Magic, which leads to our main
reason here: Magic and Abilities.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Both?”

have until evening, right? That’s plenty of time, so why not?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
have another Chemistry class with Miss Violet tonight. With the past few days only
focusing on written knowledge whether if it was with Miss Emilia or Miss Violet
or if it was here with Miss Breezy, this physical exercise feels refreshing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

have memorised that list of incantations, yes?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
put my bag down by the stands to take the scroll out. “Yup!” I look through the
words again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Tell
me, Aesena Varinas, the workings of Incantation Magic,” Miss Breezy prompts a
revision.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
look up with a ponderous tilt of my head. “Mages have their own Magical Particles
that they can control with…um…voice commands. The incantations are like
passwords, and a mage must first assign a ‘password’ to a spell before using
that very spell, so that the Magical Particles know how to perform.” I squeeze
my brain to see if I have missed out anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Oh!”
I remember. “A mage must constantly manifest her, or his, own Magical Particles
because spells can very quickly use them up.” In a way, these rules make sense.
‘The Logic Of Magic’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Not
everyone can manipulate Magic, but everyone has their own biologically
inherited Abilities, at least in modern times. You are one of the lucky ones.”
Her voice is fluffier on that last line. “Let’s start th-ah, yes, and there is actually
a short-form for the term ‘Magical Particles’: ‘Mags’.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“‘Mags’,”
I repeat, “Like ‘magazines’, like bullets in pistols and rifles? Bang, bang!” I
make a finger-gun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy laughs. “Very observant, youngling, this is the first time I made that
connection. Yes, it’s fitting, isn’t it? Magical Particles <b><i>are</i></b>
like ‘magazines’ for mages.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
turn from the weapon stands to face the vastness so cleanly laid out. “So…what
do I do? To manifest my mags? And do I just assign ‘passwords’ to them in my
head? Or must I say it aloud?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“First,
try to concentrate on the air around you, for there are already mags prepared
for you. The log-and-rock illusion and the conjuration of the library, how you
get in and out, all those have used up some of the mags, but there are still
plenty.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Of
course, now it makes more sense, but…“I didn’t use incantations for any of
them.” Oh wait, no. I did hold my hand up whenever I needed to enter or exit
the library. “The ‘passwords’ can be actions too, but I didn’t actually assign
any…Did my future-self assign it…indirectly? Or is it directly?” My mind
swings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Don’t
you concern yourself over that. It’s kind of a different scenario. As I said,
your skills will eventually transcend even the logical boundaries of magic.
You’re not expected to understand how all that works,” she explains, before
adding: “Or at least, not yet.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
try to feel the air. There is no wind, yet it is not stuffy, and nor is it hot.
It does not smell like anything either. As Miss Breezy said, this huge land is
a conjuration inside an illusion. I do not really understand it, but everything
here, including the air, is surely made from Magic. That means, as she also
said, there are leftover mags, and they should be everywhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
I do not know how to sense them, or control them. “And the…assignment of the
incantations?” I repeat my question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Pick
a spell from that list, think hard about the incantation and picture how the
spell works in your mind. Focus with emphasis. It might be a bit tricky at
first. I’m sure you must feel confused as to how to feel the mags around you,
but you will know when you know. Just go for it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
browse the list. “I’ll try the ‘Conjure A Stone’ one,” I decide. ‘Limipetram’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Focus
with emphasis’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
shut my eyes and hold my hand out, focusing on the word and trying to manifest
the picture of a stone in the back of my mind, how it is hard and solid and
rough and brown or grey. I immediately feel something click, and I almost
opened my eyes in surprise but I manage to keep them closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
want to try it. “<b><i>Limipetram</i></b>,” I call, and I hear a soft thud in
front of me. I open my eyes and let out a sigh, then I giggle, for there on the
ground sits a small rock. It is exactly as I pictured it, and that gives me a
surge of relief and pride.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That’s…an
otherworldly speed of learning.” Miss Breezy remarks with shocked pauses
between her words. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
need to try something else. The rock…I think it is a little brown in a lot of
grey, I am not sure, but it could mean that every thought I project into this
‘password assignment’ procedure counts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
bounce on the tips of my shoes. I can feel them now, or I think so, the mags; they
are like shiny sparkles that I cannot see, feathery fluffs that I cannot touch.
But they are there. It is strange. It is like a feeling I have always thought I
have felt before, and that by itself is a stranger thing to think of. A rush of
adrenaline fills me. Maybe I could impress Miss Breezy more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>As
long as I properly picture how I want the spell to work in my head, it will do
as I intend it to. There is still one more thing I need to ask Miss Breezy
about, but I have to check this out first. I imagine a stone forming, a proper
dark grey one, but this time it speeds off like a bullet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
open my eyes. “<b><i>Limi</i></b>-”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“<b><i>Navaco</i></b>,”
Miss Breezy suddenly calls, and as sudden as that the fluffiness and
sparkliness in the air disappear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
backstep in surprise, now realising something that I should have been aware of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Lucky
that I caught on in time, child. Conjuring a simple rock is very different from
firing one across the field,” she lightly scolds, “You’re very creative, but
you need to hone your control over your skills to apply all that creativity.
Every action you assign your mags to consumes stamina, and what you almost did
would have drained a day of energy off you instantly. You jumped into it too
hastily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“From
this moment onwards, please tell me the ideas you come with before you take
action,” Miss Breezy cautions. She does not seem displeased at all, but is
instead understanding. Did she already expect something like this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
sigh, softly rubbing my hands together. “I apologise. I was too wrapped up in
the heat of the moment. It was just so cool, so awesome, being able to do Magic.
I got overwhelmed. Anyway…” I falter, “how did you know? And how…” I trail off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
figured. A genius can often be impulsive.” The remark makes me look down in
embarrassment, and she continues: “The spell I used cleared up all the mags
around you, because as you stated correctly, your emotions are being
overwhelmed by them, your senses too alight, too excited. ‘N-I-L-V-A-C-U-O’,
it’s partially Latin, Leomasaen-Latin to be precise.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod in contemplation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
suppose you also wish to address my using Magic,” she notices, “Yes, I can; there
are mags for me to use around the area. But I’m only a voice, so I’m restricted
to using voice commands. Though that, it’s enough.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
feel the mags again, so fluffy and so sparkly, but it no longer has the same
effect on me as before, now that I am more careful. I think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“How
do I increase my Magical Stamina?” Is that a thing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Unlike
the games you have played before, you only have one bar, whether it being health
or stamina…or…,” she chuckles, “mana,” she chuckles again. “It’s simply the
overall energy you possess, and you can improve it by running around the
perimeter of this field the same way you can by continuously conjuring rocks.
That stone-firing spell was almost like running five miles when you can only
run three.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
cannot run three,” I state comically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Working
through that list of incantations should be enough for today. Let’s take it one
step at a time,” Miss Breezy solaces, “We’re in no rush, and it’s not like this
first mission is in need of Magic anyway. It’s just a precaution, something
extra to make you feel more confident.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
go through the list again, picking another spell. ‘Make A Plant Grow’. ‘Florosor’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Not
wanting to deviate from how I did it the first time, I close my eyes and extend
my hand, imagining a plant growing, though I cannot help but imagine it as a
rose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“<b><i>Florosor</i></b>!”
I call, opening my eyes, and a short row of grass that was flat a moment ago
stretches upwards, then their tips blossom into roses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
stare at them. Wasn’t the grass only supposed to grow taller? I must have lost
focus in my imagination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy lets out a short chuckling huff. “I see. I guess the incantation <b><i>is</i></b>
a little off-putting. You see, these are just the incantations commonly taught
to mages, so it is easier to train them. Governments also wanted to structure
the learning system for Magic, therefore a general list was made.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That
piques my curiosity. “To monitor the mages?” To keep them under the thumb, more
like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“More
or less. It makes everything a little more understandable, at least.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
muse on that. “What if I assign two ‘passwords’ to a spell, or maybe three? One
would be the common incantation used by everyone else, and the other would be
only known to me. Wouldn’t it be a surprise to an opponent mage, if I ever need
to go against one?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’re
not battling a mage anytime soon,” she assures me in an amused tone, “But I see
what you mean. Getting innovative, there is also the tactic where you can use
the same incantation, but for a different spell altogether. Like that
stone-firing case where you decided to use ‘Limipetram’, and this ‘Florosor’
that didn’t work as planned. These are a lot of roses, though, don’t you feel
tired?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Had
Miss Breezy not mentioned it, I would not have felt the slight exhaustion. ‘Slight’,
but now my head swirls and I need to pant as I breathe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“The

yourself?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“<b><i>Resmedella</i></b>,”
I call instinctively. This is the one spell I made sure to memorise. I did not
know why my mind deemed the incantation more necessary than the rest, but now I
do. ‘Just in case’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“That
was just a minor stamina restoration,” Miss Breezy points out. “That’s why you
must always be careful with how you use Magic. If it was easy, anyone could do
it. But to be extremely honest, you progress astoundingly fast. That’s only
natural, I guess.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Since
it is my destiny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Oh
and by the way, you don’t need to hold your hands out with every spell, or even
shut your eyes.” she adds, with a tone that suggests that she is holding back a
spurt of chuckles. “Too many movies again, Aesena Varinas.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
immediately feel myself grow red. “But…” I blink, “I thought…the
log-and-rock…that time…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I
understand that it would be easier for you to focus if you do it the way you
think you should,” she says, “But, as you just addressed, in a combat using
Magic, you would be better off without unnecessary movements. Someday, you
might even be able to cast spells without incantations, and your mags will
behave as you wish them to just via train of thought.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
cannot imagine myself throwing spells with a rigid body. It is almost like
betraying the movies and shows I have watched. I erupt into laughter on how
ridiculous my thoughts are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You
can, of course, continue doing that in your practices,” she goes on, “But I
advise you to not allow yourself to get used to it. Don’t cultivate senseless
behaviours, especially at the beginning, they might become a burden further on.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
nod.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Right.
<b><i>Reversiso</i></b>.” And the roses shrink back into grass, the field
returning to normal. The stone I conjured just now vanishes as well. “On to the
next one.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Are
all spells in Latin?” I notice the pattern. It is not like I am well-versed in
the language, but the words Miss Breezy used sounded like so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Most,
and well, they’re not fully properly Latin. Incantations shouldn’t be actual
words as to make it easier for mages to record them down, and also to prevent
misunderstandings. The Yuhenici were the ones to systemise Magical Incantations
over here in this continent, so they used their secondary language.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
hum. “What if I use gibberish as a ‘password’?” I take the list out of my
pocket again to pick another spell. ‘Make hover’ this time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
try picturing the spell working without closing my eyes, but it is not too hard
imagining something floating. I swing the scroll into the air. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“<b><i>Blabidi
blabida</i></b>!” I call with enthusiasm, and as certain as my confidence, the
scroll starts falling like a gentle leaf. It is actually weird if I look at it
for too long. I think…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“<b><i>Yippa</i></b>!”
And the scroll fly into my hands again, neatly and nicely folded. I look to
where I assume Miss Breezy is ‘breezing’ about, and smile with pride.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“You’re
a very cheeky girl! That was such a comedic scene to watch,” she giggles with
me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“‘Blabidi
Blabida’ might be too long an incantation to use. But ‘Yippa’ sounds fun! It
will certainly baffle anyone that hears it. I’ll keep that one,” I announce.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It
certainly did baffle me.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
huff in laughter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“<b><i>Resmedella</i></b>,”
I call, and my energy refills. I do not actually know whether or not it did
refill, but it makes it easier if I can imagine a stamina bar slowly being
restored.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“It’s
another bad habit to spam healing spells unnecessarily on yourself,” Miss
Breezy observes. “No matter how cautious you want to be.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Hehe.”
I did not think she would understand as quickly as she did, but of course. I
put my hands behind me. “That will be the last time.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Alright,
you can make your own incantations if you prefer. Be extra careful however,
gibberish is a very casual language. You might unintentionally send a flowerpot
crashing into your face.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
imagine myself throwing open the door into the greenhouse, exclaiming ‘<b><i>Yippa</i></b>!’,
accidentally calling something random and letting it hurl itself at me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“True…”
I rub my cheek.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Miss
Breezy laughs. “I was joking. You need to call the incantation like you
actually mean it for a spell to work. Anyway, let’s finish up the list so I can
brief you through Sharp and Screen Abilities. With how fast you’re learning, we’ll
be done with today’s quota in no time.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Quota’?
I smile at that. And…“Do I start copying the book tomorrow?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> “Yes.
This is just a fun introduction. Tomorrow, you’ll focus on Magic that helps you
on documenting and revising, like I said before. Those spells are more
important,” she says. “Finally, right?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
make a funny face. After today, I have no excuse to not start working on the
task. Reading the book was fun, however, so maybe it will not be as tedious as
I imagine it could be. And I am pretty looking forward to see how the
Handwriting-Tracing Spell works.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Right!
Moving on: ‘Make frozen’!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB

I deliberate.</span></p>
